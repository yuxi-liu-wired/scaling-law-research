 homarus gammarus homarus gammarus , known as the european lobster or common lobster , is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern atlantic ocean , mediterranean sea and parts of the black sea . it is closely related to the american lobster , h. americanus . it may grow to a length of cm in and a mass of kilograms lb , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . in life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming lobster red on cooking . mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae . homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the british isles . description homarus gammarus is a large crustacean , with a body length up to centimetres in and weighing up to kilograms lb , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually cm in long and weigh . . kg . . lb . like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called ecdysis moulting . this may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every years for larger animals . the first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . the larger one is the crusher , and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey the other is the cutter , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . usually , the left claw is the crusher , and the right is the cutter . the exoskeleton is generally blue above , with spots that coalesce , and yellow below . the red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . this occurs because , in life , the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . the closest relative of h. gammarus is the american lobster , homarus americanus . the two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . the two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics the rostrum of h. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in h. gammarus . the spines on the claws of h. americanus are red or red tipped , while those of h. gammarus are white or white tipped . the underside of the claw of h. americanus is orange or red , while that of h. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red . life cycle female h. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of millimetres . . in , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard shelled male . the female carries the eggs for up to months , depending on the temperature , attached to her pleopods . females carrying eggs are said to be berried and can be found throughout the year . the eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on zooplankton . this stage involves three moults and lasts for days . after the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a benthic lifestyle . the juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . it is estimated that only larva in every , survives to the benthic phase . when they reach a carapace length of mm . in , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives . distribution homarus gammarus is found across the north eastern atlantic ocean from northern norway to the azores and morocco , not including the baltic sea . it is also present in most of the mediterranean sea , only missing from the section east of crete , and along only the north west coast of the black sea . the northernmost populations are found in the norwegian fjords tysfjorden and nordfolda , inside the arctic circle . the species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . the first of these is the population of lobsters from northern norway , which have been referred to as the midnight sun lobster . the populations in the mediterranean sea are distinct from those in the atlantic ocean . the last distinct population is found in the netherlands samples from the oosterschelde were distinct from those collected in the north sea or english channel . attempts have been made to introduce h. gammarus to new zealand , alongside other european species such as the edible crab , cancer pagurus . between and , one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in dunedin , but the species did not become established there . ecology adult h. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of metres ft , although not normally deeper than m ft . they prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . the diet of h. gammarus mostly consists of other benthic invertebrates . these include crabs , molluscs , sea urchins , starfish and polychaete worms . the three clawed lobster species homarus gammarus , h. americanus and nephrops norvegicus are hosts to the three known species of the animal phylum cycliophora the species on h. gammarus has not been described . homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease gaffkaemia , caused by the bacterium aerococcus viridans . although it is frequently found in american lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive h. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by h. americanus could not be ruled out . human consumption homarus gammarus is traditionally highly esteemed as a foodstuff and was mentioned in the crabfish a seventeenth century english folk song . it may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . both the claws and the abdomen of h. gammarus contain excellent white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . the exceptions are the gastric mill and the sand vein gut . the price of h. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of h. americanus , and the european species is considered to have a better flavour . lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . in , , t of h. gammarus were caught across europe and north africa , of which , t was caught in the british isles including the channel islands . the minimum landing size for h. gammarus is a carapace length of mm . in . aquaculture systems for h. gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low . taxonomic history homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by carl linnaeus in the tenth edition of his systema naturae , published in . that name was cancer gammarus , since linnaeus concept of the genus cancer at that time included all large crustaceans . h. gammarus is the type species of the genus homarus weber , , as determined by direction of the international commission on zoological nomenclature . prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including astacus marinus fabricius , and homarus vulgaris h. milne edwards , , and also because friedrich weber s description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by mary rathbun , rendering any prior assignments of type species for homarus h. milne edwards , invalid for homarus weber , . the type specimen of homarus gammarus was a lectotype selected by lipke holthuis in . it came from n e , near marstrand , sweden kilometres or miles northwest of gothenburg , but both it and the paralectotypes have since been lost . the common name for h. gammarus preferred by the food and agriculture organization is european lobster , but the species is also widely known as the common lobster . frank headlam air vice marshal frank headlam , cb , cbe july december was a senior commander in the royal australian air force raaf . born and educated in

states under the terms of the treaty of dancing rabbit creek in during the period of indian removal . after the treaty was ratified , european american settlers began to move into the area . after receiving a federal land grant of about , acres ha , richard mclemore , the first settler of meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . most of mclemore s land was bought in by lewis a. ragsdale , a lawyer from alabama . john t. ball , a merchant from kemper county , bought the remaining acres . km . ragsdale and ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections . there was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement . ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name meridian , believing the term to be synonymous with junction the more agrarian residents of the city preferred sowashee meaning mad river in a native american language , from the name of a nearby creek and ragsdale proposed ragsdale city . ball erected a station house on the mobile and ohio railroad the sign on which would alternate between meridian and sowashee each day . eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left meridian on the station permanently . the town was officially incorporated as meridian on february , . meridian was a small village at the start of the american civil war in . its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the confederate construction of several military installations to support the war . during the battle of meridian in , general william tecumseh sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense storehouses his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . sherman is reported to have said afterwards , meridian , with its depots , store houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and cantonments no longer exists . despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation working days after the battle . race relations remained tense during the reconstruction era , with the riot of following a fire that damaged many businesses . the town boomed in the aftermath of the civil war , and experienced its golden age from to . the railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . as the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area . between and , meridian was the largest city in mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the south . many of the city s historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the grand opera house in , the wechsler school in , two carnegie libraries in , and the threefoot building , meridian s tallest skyscraper , in . the city continued to grow thanks to a commission government s efforts to bring in new industrial plants in and a booming automobile industry in the s . even through the stock market crash of and the following great depression , the city continued to attract new businesses . with escapism becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the depression , the s. h. kress co. building , built to provide luxury to the common man , opened in downtown meridian , as did the temple theater , which was used as a movie house . the federal courthouse was built in as a wpa project . after a brief slowdown of the economy at the end of the depression , the country entered world war ii , which renewed the importance of railroads . the rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so meridian became the region s rail center again . this renewed prosperity continued until the s , when the automobile and interstate highway system became more popular than passenger rails . the decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas . during the american civil rights movement in the s , meridian was home to a council of federated organizations cofo office and several other activist organizations . james chaney and other local residents , along with michael schwerner , his wife rita , and andrew goodman , volunteers from the north , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare african americans in the area to regain the power to vote . whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence . in june , chaney , schwerner , and goodman went to neshoba county , mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . the three disappeared that night on their way back to meridian . following a massive fbi investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam . seven klansmen , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal courthouse in meridian of depriving the victims of their civil rights and three were acquitted in the mississippi civil rights workers murders trial . it was the first time that a white jury had convicted a white official in a civil rights killing . in , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time . edgar ray killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to years in prison . meridian later honored chaney by renaming a portion of th avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service . starting in the s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . after strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the s and s to preserve the architectural character of the city . the meridian historic districts and landmarks commission was created in , and the meridian main street program was founded in . meridian main street organized several projects to revitalize downtown , including the construction of a new amtrak station in based on the design of the historic train station used during meridian s golden age it had been demolished . other projects included the renovation of the rosenbaum building in and weidmann s restaurant in , as well as support for integrated urban design . meridian main street , along with the riley foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic grand opera house in for use as the mississippi state university riley center for education and the performing arts . after ownership of the meridian main street was transferred to the alliance for downtown meridian in late , the two organizations , along with the meridian downtown association , spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort . the alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . plans were underway to renovate the threefoot building , but newly elected mayor cheri barry killed the plans in early . today , the alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night . the meridian downtown association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the meridian main street program supports existing businesses downtown . hotels given

the city s core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling african american could find a room . as the city suburbs developed in the s and s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . rehabilitation of the riley center in has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel . the threefoot building has been proposed for redevelopment for

papa stour is one of the shetland islands in scotland , with a population of under twenty people , some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the s . located to the west of mainland shetland and with an area of hectares . square miles , papa stour is the eighth largest island in shetland . erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , and cliffs . the island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife . the west side of the island is a site of special scientific interest and the seas around the island are a special area of conservation . the island has several neolithic burial chamber sites , as well as the remains of duke hakon s th century house dating from the norse occupation of the island . the population reached or more in the nineteenth century , when a fishing station was opened at crabbaberry in west voe . subsequently there was a steady decline in population , although the numbers have increased from a low of in the s . today the main settlement on the island is biggings , just to the east of which is housa voe from where the snolda ferry arrives from its base at west burrafirth on the shetland mainland . crofting , especially sheep rearing , is the mainstay of island life . numerous shipwrecks have occurred around the coast , and the celebrated poem da sang o da papa men by vagaland recalls the drama of the days when papa stour was a centre for deep sea fishing . geography papa stour is located at the south western end of st magnus bay . there are kilometres mi of rugged coastline which is indented by numerous small embayments and four larger voes . hamna voe old norse harbour bay in the south is the most sheltered anchorage and the surrounding cliffs contain a natural rock arch . housa voe to the east old norse house bay is less secluded but is the main harbour for the island and the ferry s embarkation point . brei holm and maiden stack guard the harbour entrance to the south . the former is a tidal island and was a leper colony until the th century although it has been suggested that many of the lepers there were suffering from a vitamin deficiency rather than leprosy . the latter s name relates to a story from the th century . lord thorvald thoresson is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top , whose ruins are still visible , in order to preserve his daughter from men . unfortunately for his plans , when she left she was found to be pregnant in another version of the story , she and her fisherman sweetheart successfully eloped . west voe , the inner part of which is called robies noust is the main voe in the north coast , the smaller culla voe lying immediately to the west . the main settlement on the island today is biggings , which overlooks housa voe and is surrounded by in bye land to the east of the hill dyke which runs south from west voe . to the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length . much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till . there is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile . the lack of peat led to turf scalping for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior . the highest point on the island is in the north west at virda field , which rises to metres feet . virda is possibly from the old norse for heap of stones . list of outliers in addition to the larger islets mentioned above there are various other isles and skerries around the coast of papa stour . they include aesha stack , boinna skerry , borse skerry , fogla skerry , forewick holm , galti stacks , holm of melby , koda skerry , lyra skerry , skerries of quidaness , skerry of lambaness , sula stack , swat skerry , the horn , tiptans skerry and wilma skerry . the ve skerries lie kilometres . mi to the north west . they include helliogoblo , north skerry , ormal , reaverack and the clubb . in between papa stour and ve skerries lies the shallow bank of papa rof . on june , stuart hill , the owner and only resident of the hectare . acres island of forewick holm which he has renamed forvik island made a declaration of dependence , creating the crown dependency of forvik . on the basis of a marriage arrangement between king christian of norway and king james iii of scotland that dates to , hill argued that the island should be considered a british crown dependency , and thus not a part of the united kingdom or of the european union . this claim was not recognised by the united kingdom . geology the island is composed of a variety of volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the devonian period . at that time the scottish landmass formed part of the old red sandstone continent and lay some degrees south of the equator . the accumulations of old red sandstone , laid down from to million years ago , were created as earlier silurian rocks , uplifted by the formation of pangaea , eroded and then were deposited into river deltas . the freshwater lake orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from shetland to the southern moray firth . the structure of papa stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava rhyolite , but there is also a devonian fish bed at lamba banks . there are numerous large boulders deposited by pleistocene glaciation . erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , cliffs , voes and geos that are amongst the finest in britain . the holl o boardie is a cave that passes right through the north west tip of the island . it is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through . kirstan or christie s hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in . yet another is francie s hole close to hamna voe in the west . this was the favourite of john tudor who wrote of the island in his victorian memoirs and described the cave as ... in fairyland , so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so pellucid is the water ... with alcoves or recesses like stalls in a church . in the spectacular headland , da horn o papa fell into the sea during a storm . the nearby islet of brei holm also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit . ecology otters , grey seals , killer whales and harbour porpoises are frequently seen on and around papa stour . atlantic puffin , arctic and common tern , bonxie and arctic skua , northern fulmar , common guillemot , razorbill , curlew , wheatear , ringed plover and great black backed gull all breed on the island , and numerous migratory species have been recorded . there is a profusion of wild flowers , including mountain everlasting , spring squill and eyebright as well as the ubiquitous heather . the west side of the island is a site of special scientific interest and the seas around papa stour are a special area of conservation . the traditional shetland pony is still bred . history and archaeology human settlement of the island dates from circa bc and there are remains of several neolithic burial chambers known as heel shaped cairns . little is known of the pre celtic and celtic eras , but when the norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from papey stra meaning big island of the papar celtic monks , in distinction to papa little some kilometres . mi to the west . norse period papa stour is the subject of a manuscript written in old norse , which is the oldest surviving document from shetland . it deals with a dramatic incident in the house of duke hakon magnusson , who was later to become king hakon v of norway . there is a circle of stones near the beach at housa voe , which are the remains of a ting , or local assembly . this was the scene of a duel , fought and won by lord thorvald thoresson , who was accused of corruption in the document and was later called dominus de papay . the story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above . the remains of duke hakon s thirteenth century house are still visible near housa voe . scots rule and fishing in shetland came under nominal scottish control , although the norse lairds of norway kept their papa stour estates until the th century . in the th century merchants from bremen and hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet . by the th century , two scottish lairds , thomas gifford of busta , and arthur nicolson of lerwick , owned the island . they maintained a prosperous haaf old norse deep sea fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six oared boats known as sixareens . in addition to the leper colony on brei holm there may have been another at hilla fielle overlooking hamna voe . a recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed th century colony . the island church , which overlooks kirk sand in the bay of fore wick , was founded in . metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of sneeans or snyans on the headland between the west end of kirk sand and the bay of tusselby . it is called the ald kirk by locals and referred to by the ordnance survey as the site of a romish chapel belonging to about the twelfth century . there is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day s work on the building was destroyed during the night . eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re commenced there successfully . excavations in found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it . in the th century the crabbaberry fishing station in west voe was opened and the island had a population of people or more . however , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the s on . at this time another duel entered the history of papa stour . edwin lindsay , an indian army officer and the son of the th earl of balcarres , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one . he spent years as a prisoner before the quaker preacher catherine watson arranged for his release in . lindsay s well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe . there are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as norse or clack mills , around dutch loch . originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill stone was sited . inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone , and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below . some were still in use on papa stour in the early years of the th century , and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the burn of clumlie , at troswick in the south mainland of shetland . th and st centuries in common with many small scottish islands , papa stour s population peaked in the th century and has experienced a significant decline since then see e.g. mingulay . by the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen fairly elderly residents , but an advertisement in exchange and mart reversed the decline . a croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants . by the census recorded a population of . however , by the population had fallen to after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases . a number of people left the island and the school closed . by early the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left . the census recorded a usually resident population of during the decade scottish island populations as a whole grew by to , . overview of population trends shipwrecks the coasts around papa stour have claimed numerous wrecks . in hamnavoe , tiptans skerry alone has sunk dutch , french , german and norwegian ships . the aberdeen trawler ben doran a , foundered on the ve skerries miles northwest of papa stour , on the evening of march while on her way to the village of scalloway to land her catch . when she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck . by the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers there being no lifeboat in shetland at that time , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries . a request had been made for the stromness lifeboat from orkney , only miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help . all crew perished in the wreck . only bodies were recovered , that of james mitchell , which was returned to aberdeen , and the bodies of j. cormack and j.r. insh , which were buried in scalloway . the cargo ship ss highcliffe ran aground in fog on forewick holm in february . on this occasion the conditions were clement and only the ship and cargo were lost . in the aberdeen trawler juniper ran aground in lyra sound at the bottom of the metres feet cliffs . the man crew were rescued by the aith lifeboat , the coxswain being awarded the rnli silver medal for this rescue . papa stour s most recent shipwreck occurred on december when the aberdeen trawler elinor viking a , skipper alec flett , foundered on the ve skerries . the aith lifeboat came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions . at the request of alec webster , coastguard station officer , lerwick , a volunteer crew in a british airways sikorsky sn helicopter from sumburgh airport was scrambled . they managed to winch all the boat s crew to safety within hours of the grounding , despite the storm force winds . the helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery . there was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present search and rescue helicopter unit , based at sumburgh airport . economy transport crofting is the mainstay of island life . sheep form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept , including cattle , pigs , goats , chickens , ducks and geese . vegetable are grown too , often in the shelter of circular walls , such plots being known as plantie scrubs . fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale . there is a post office at the pier , but no shop . mains electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century . the papa stour project is a christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues . ferries now sail across the sound of papa to west burrafirth on the shetland mainland . the crossing takes minutes , and although the snolda carries cars , there is only one short road on the island.for visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter , but the strong tides in both the sound of papa and to the north west require considerable care . airstrip there is an airstrip which caters for regular flights from tingwall . culture and the arts the papa stour sword dance may be of norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of england . a description of the dance appears in the pirate by sir walter scott . the writer and journalist john sands lived on papa stour and foula for a while during the late nineteenth century . the writer , folklorist and musician , george p. s. peterson was brought up on papa stour . it is also the papa of vagaland s poem da sang o da papa men , now adopted as part of the folksong tradition , as set to music by t.m.y. manson . the insistent chorus chant , rowin foula doon , is particularly striking . oot bewast da horn o papa , rowin foula doon owir a hidden piece o water , rowin foula doon roond da boat da tide lumps makkin , sunlicht trowe da cloods is brakkin we maan geng whaar fish is takkin , rowin foula doon rowin foula doon refers to the fishermens practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of foula were no longer visible . this entailed the boat being some kilometres mi west of papa stour . the tide lumps are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide . the resonant final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to papa by the scent o flooers across the water . this is an example of vagaland s ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation . an extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that da horn o papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem s composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature . angel of death slayer song angel of death is the opening track on the american thrash metal band slayer s album reign in blood . the lyrics and music were written by slayer guitarist , jeff hanneman and are based on nazi physician josef mengele , who conducted human experiments at the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii . angel of death led to the band facing accusations of nazi sympathizing and racism throughout their career . despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of reign in blood , angel of death is featured on all of slayer s live albums and dvds and has appeared in several movies . the song was well received by critics steve huey of allmusic described it as a classic . composition and origins slayer guitarist jeff hanneman wrote angel of death after reading books about nazi physician josef mengele while on tour with the band i remember stopping someplace where i bought two books on mengele . i thought , this has gotta be some sick shit . so when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head that s where the lyrics to angel of death came from . the lyrics detail mengele s surgical experiments on patients at the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii . mengele s explorations were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations . among the tests he performed that are mentioned in angel of death are experimental surgeries performed without anesthesia , transfusion of blood between twins , isolation endurance , gassing , injections with lethal germs , sex change operations , the removal of organs and limbs , and abacination . sewn together , joining heads . just a matter of time til you rip yourselves apart , a line from the penultimate verse , is a reference to the allegation mengele stitched together twins , one of them deformed the hunchback was sewn to the other child , back to back , their wrists back to back too . this claim was first made by auschwitz survivor vera alexander at the trial of ss hauptscharfhrer adolf eichmann the architect of the holocaust , where it was asserted that mengele sewed the veins together and turned them into siamese twins . this allegation became more widely known when vera alexander was featured in the documentary the search for mengele , which has been cited by several authors including gerald posner , an expert on mengele . towards the end of the song , there is a line feeding off the screams of the mutants he s creating , which was taken from the film the boys from brazil in which dr. mengele was the villain . controversy the lyrical content of angel of death contributed to the delay of the release of slayer s album reign in blood . the band were signed to def jam records whose distributor , columbia records , refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns , deeming the artwork too graphic . reign in blood was eventually distributed by geffen records on october , . however , due to the controversy , reign in blood did not appear on geffen records official release schedule . angel of death caused outrage among survivors of the holocaust , as well as their families and the general public . the controversy led to accusations of nazi sympathizing which have followed slayer throughout their career . people took hanneman s interest in nazi history and his collection of nazi medals as evidence of sympathizing his most prized item being a german knight s cross . hanneman counteracted asserting i know why people misinterpret it it s because they get this knee jerk reaction to it . when they read the lyrics , there s nothing i put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man , because to me well , isn t that obvious i shouldn t have to tell you that . according to guitarist kerry king yeah , slayer are nazis , fascists , communists all that fun shit . and of course we got the most flak for it in germany . i was always like , read the lyrics and tell me what s offensive about it . can you see it as a documentary , or do you think slayer s preaching fucking world war ii people get this thought in their heads especially in europe and you ll never talk them out of it . the song drew accusations of racism , which the band has denied . the band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews , and have stated numerous times that they do not condone racism and are merely interested in the subject . in , the song jihad from slayer s album christ illusion drew comparison to angel of death . jihad deals with the september , , attacks , and tells the story from a terrorist s perspective . vocalist araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of angel of death , although it did not materialise , in part , he believes , due to peoples view that the song is just slayer being slayer . music and structure angel of death is the longest track on the album reign in blood , spanning minutes and seconds , where the total duration of the album is minutes . additionally , it has one of the most conventional song structures on the album , featuring prominent verses and choruses , where most tracks on the album eschew them . hanneman and king deliver their intricate riffs , which offer the few hints of melody on the album according to popmatters reviewer adrien begrand , and araya bursts out his piercing scream , with lombardo performing beats of beats per minute . when drummer lombardo left slayer in , the band hired a full time replacement in forbidden drummer paul bostaph . bostaph made one mistake out of the nine songs the band trialled him with , on angel of death . before the big double bass part there is a lead section , which bostaph could not understand , as he had to learn from live records recorded with lombardo . bostaph could not tell how many revolutions the guitar riff goes before the bass sequence . the band members told him there were eight , perfecting the song afterwards . reception although angel of death did not enter any charts , it received strong praise from critics in reviews for reign in blood . clay jarvas of stylus magazine noted that the song smokes the asses of any band playing fast and or heavy today . lyrically outlining the horrors to come , while musically laying the groundwork for the rest of the record fast , lean and filthy . adrien begrand of popmatters remarked that there s no better song to kick things off than the masterful angel of death , one of the most monumental songs in metal history , where guitarists kerry king and jeff hanneman deliver their intricate riffs , drummer dave lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded , and bassist vocalist tom araya screams and snarls his tale of nazi war criminal josef mengele . capitalizing on the publicity generated by the controversy , the band utilized nazi imagery by adapting a logo to one similar to the eagle atop swastika , during the seasons in the abyss period . hanneman placed ss stickers on his guitar , and wrote ss a song about reinhard heydrich , the second in command in the schutzstaffel organization . appearances angel of death has appeared in several movies and tv shows including gremlins the new batch in a scene when the gremlin mohawk is turning into a spider , jackass the movie during a car stunt , the iraq war documentary soundtrack to war , which details the role of music on the contemporary battlefield , and on an episode of the leftovers when nora asks a female escort to shoot her . the half time riff was sampled by public enemy in their song she watch channel zero , sampled by m.o.p. in their song raise hell , which appeared in the breaking bad episode thirty eight snub , and sampled by kmfdm on their single godlike , and featured in the multi platform video game tony hawk s project . nolan nelson , who selected the soundtrack for the game asserts the song is one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever recorded . don t know who slayer is i feel sorry for you . a slayer tribute band called dead skin mask released an album with eight slayer tracks , angel of death being one of them . the death metal bands debauchery and monstrosity covered the song , and the track was featured on cello metal band apocalyptica s album amplified a decade of reinventing the cello . sgt. discharge , a thrash metal band with members from morbid saint , has also covered this song . al sur del abismo tributo argentino a slayer , a slayer tribute album compiled by hurling metal records , featured sixteen tracks covered by argentina metal bands , asinesia covered angel of death . the song was once again covered by deathcore band carnifex and appears on their third album hell chose me as a bonus track included on the vinyl and itunes editions . a compilation album of bands that have been featured in the ozzfest line up , of which slayer have headlined multiple times , features angel of death . the song saw a release as playable downloadable content in the game rocksmith . calvin mccarty calvin

discrimination and segregation that lead belly faced during a visit to washington , dc to record for alan lomax . it rails against racism , the jim crow laws , and the conditions of contemporary african americans in the southern united states . the song was recorded in december for the library of congress and re recorded in for commercial release . it has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including pete seeger , ry cooder , hans theessink , and billy bragg . the bourgeois blues is regarded as one of lead belly s best original works , but it also drew controversy . there is doubt over the song s authorship , with some scholars contending that lead belly was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator . questions have been raised over his role in the american communist party and whether he and the song were used to further the party s political goals . background and creation most music historians date the writing of the bourgeois blues to lead belly s june trip to washington , dc , when he was invited by the folklorist alan lomax to record for the library of congress s folk music collection . on the first night lead belly and his wife martha spent in the city , they encountered racially discriminatory jim crow laws similar to those found in their native louisiana most hotels refused to rent rooms to african americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man lomax . lomax , in some versions of the story described as an unnamed white friend , offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the supreme court building . the next morning , lead belly awoke to lomax arguing with his landlord about the presence of a black man , with the landlord threatening to call the police . while in washington , lead belly encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the impetus of the song . for instance , when lead belly , lomax , and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together , they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them . lead belly was told that if he returned later without lomax , he would be served . in response to one of these incidents , a friend of lead belly s , variously identified as either lomax or mary elizabeth barnicle joked that washington was a bourgeois town . though lead belly did not know what the word bourgeois meant , he was fascinated by the sound of it , and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip . the song came together quickly one account claims that it only took a few hours for lead belly to write it . lomax liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment . lyrics , themes and music the bourgeois blues is a blues style protest song that criticizes the culture of washington , dc . it protests against both the city s jim crow laws and the racism of its white population . its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to spread the news all around about the racial issues plaguing the city . the song , particularly in the refrain , conflates race and economics by referring to caucasians as bourgeois . the first two verses speak of the segregation that lead belly encountered in washington dc the first recounts the fact that during the trip , lead belly was turned down wherever he tried to get served due to his race , while the second recounts the argument between lomax and his landlord over lead belly staying in his apartment . the third verse sarcastically cites the home of the brave , the land of the free , juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in washington , dc . the fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city , leading to the song s end , which suggests that african americans boycott buying homes in the district . the song s tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters despite this , by spreading the news of his poor treatment in a song , the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern african americans and northern whites that the status quo is deeply flawed and that something needs to change . the bourgeois blues follows a traditional twelve bar blues format . it is written in time but annotated to note that the song rhythmically should swing at medium shuffle . the song was written in b . it uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating , followed by the final two verses and a coda . recordings and adaptions lead belly first recorded the bourgeois blues in december in new york city , for donation to the library of congress . he re recorded the song in april for musicraft records , for release the same year as a rpm record . the version that was commercially released features lead belly singing and playing the twelve string guitar without any other accompaniment . the song has been covered and reinterpreted by a variety of artists including pete seeger and hans theessink . seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums . in australia , the song was reworked as canberra blues by the bitter lemons , an r b band . the lyrics speak of the problems faced by young australians in the australian capital territory in the s . theessink adapted the song to his style of european blues for the album journey on in . in , billy bragg reworked the song as bush war blues . bragg s cover is a topical protest song about the iraq war . in one verse , bragg claims that the iraq war was not for democracy but instead was to make the world safe for halliburton . in another , he takes on the christian right , asking where the moderates are . finally , bragg chides the united states government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war . legacy the bourgeois blues is one of lead belly s most famous songs and is remembered as his most heartfelt protest song . there is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance . robert springer claims that the song is peripheral to the wider study of the blues , while lawson points to it as a watershed in the way african americans see themselves in the fabric of the united states . there is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics . after its release , it became popular with left wing political groups . lead belly was invited to perform at camp unity , the communist party usa s summer retreat , and the fbi subsequently opened a file on him in the s . this led to the accusations that the communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform . the party claims , to the contrary , that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform . jeff todd titon and several other writers have suggested that lead belly had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song . this theory stems from the idea that lead belly did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by lomax . since the music that lomax recorded was sold to northerners sympathetic to civil rights , it has been suggested that lomax helped him write a song attractive to a white audience . lead belly admitted that the term bourgeois was unfamiliar to him , and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work . sorry madonna song sorry is a song by american singer madonna from her tenth studio album confessions on a dance floor . it was written and produced by madonna and stuart price ,

antiquated partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the s . the million project was started in and completed in december . it was designed by the hntb corporation and built by zachry construction corporation . the interchange is considered by popular mechanics to be one of the world s strangest roadways because of its height as high as a story building , its permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features . in , the american public works association named the high five interchange as public works projects of the year . description the high five interchange , north of downtown in dallas , texas , is a massive five level freeway interchange . it is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the lyndon b. johnson freeway interstate and the central expressway us , and is the first five level stack interchange to be built in the city . it replaces the antiquated three level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing us down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways . the looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic . left hand exits contributed to the congestion . further , its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult . alluding to the celebratory gesture , the high five name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left turn movements that tower over the landscape . the interchange is as high as a story building , and includes bridges spread across five levels the high five , support tiers , and miles of additional highway . the highest ramps are feet m above ground . the lanes of us , which are on the bottom level , are feet m below ground level , giving the structure a total height of feet from bottom to top as part of the project , i was widened to include four dedicated high occupancy vehicle lanes hov lanes that are barrier separated and reversible . the roads on the five levels are level i us , an eight lane highway , four lanes going each way level ii the junction of the two six lane frontage roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left turn lanes and turnarounds , and easy access to us and i level iii i , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four hov lanes two going each way separated by barriers level iv and v direct connection ramps two levels , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf the interchange , with its decorative etchings on precast concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the texas department of transportation txdot , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art . the high five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the cottonwood trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange . the section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the high five project by txdot . the interchange is considered by popular mechanics as one of the world s strangest roadways , calling it a labyrinth of lanes and a five level marvel of engineering because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features . history the high five interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing , antiquated interchange that accommodated , vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in dallas . it was a collaborative project between the txdot , affected motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor , zachry construction . an essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible . reasons for upgrading the interchange , in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access . zachry construction corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the million contract by txdot , the largest ever by that agency . the construction contract for the high five interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts . for example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete s strength the first time txdot had ever done so , and contained an early completion bonus , a sliding scale of up to million if the company completed the contract within four years . also built into the construction contract was a provision that zachry was charged for lane rentals by txdot for time they closed down traffic lanes fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed . the fees ranged from to a high of , for rush hours . in order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished . to save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed the original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans used to direct connect roads to be made of steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast in place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans . however , zachry decided to use precast concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by deal s.r.l. of italy and costing about million , to move the pieces into place . during the construction , . million cubic yards of earthwork was used , , cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and , square feet of retaining walls were built . additionally , , feet of drilled shafts and , linear feet of drainage pipe were completed . in addition to the construction of permanent bridges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting in . million square feet of bridge deck . the project was designed by the hntb corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , which had begun in and was completed in december , more than months sooner than planned . awards in , the american public works association named the high five public works project of the year for its massive size , its innovative design , the complexity and rapidity of its construction and the need it fulfilled for the community . txdot as the managing agency , zachry construction corporation as the primary contractor , and hntb corporation as the primary consultant received the award in recognition of their cooperative alliance in completing the project . tim richmond tim richmond june , august , was an american race car driver from ashland , ohio . he competed in indycar racing before transferring to nascar s winston cup series now sprint cup series . richmond was one of the first drivers to change from open wheel racing to nascar stock cars full time , which has since become an industry trend . he won the indianapolis rookie of the year award and had victories during eight nascar seasons . richmond achieved his top nascar season in when he finished third in points . he won seven races that season , more than any other driver on the tour . when he missed the season opening daytona in february , media reported that he had pneumonia . the infection most likely resulted from his compromised immune system , which was weakened by aids . despite the state of his health , richmond competed in eight races in , winning two events and one pole position before his final race in august of that year . he attempted a comeback in before nascar i banned him for testing positive for excessive otc over the counter drugs , ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine nascar later announced they gave tim richmond a new test and tested negative . tim richmond filed a lawsuit against nascar after nascar insisted they wanted access to his entire medical record before they would reinstate him , after losing the lawsuit , richmond withdrew from racing . nascar later stated their original test was a bad test . richmond grew up in a wealthy family and lived a freewheeling lifestyle , earning him the nickname hollywood . in describing richmond s influence in racing , charlotte motor speedway president humpy wheeler said we ve never had a race driver like tim in stock car racing . he was almost a james dean like character . when richmond was cast for a bit part in the movie stroker ace , he fell right in with the group working on the film , said director hal needham . cole trickle , the main character in the movie days of thunder , played by tom cruise , was loosely based on richmond and his interaction with harry hyde and rick hendrick . early life richmond grew up in ashland , ohio . his parents , al and evelyn ne warner richmond , met in the course of their work . al was a welder for pipe construction companies and evelyn was a field office manager . noticing that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe , al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway . to market this invention , he founded richmond manufacturing , which eventually exported machines worldwide . tim s driving days started as a toddler when he was given a go kart that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn . he later raced the kart at tracks in moreland and new pittsburg . richmond grew up in a well to do family , and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates , so his parents enrolled him in miami military academy in miami , florida . during his years in miami , tim and his mother moved to florida and his father stayed in ohio . while home in ohio over a summer break , he met local drag racer raymond beadle through lifelong friend fred miller . when richmond reached age , his parents purchased him a pontiac trans am , a speedboat and a piper cherokee airplane for his birthday . yet his mother evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son . she once said , tim was lazy ... , and ... i did everything for him . i ruined him , i admit it . he was my whole life . richmond excelled in sports he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron days were over . miami military academy named him athlete of the year in . richmond s other interests included flying , and he earned his private pilot license at age . following high school graduation , richmond attended ashland university for about one year before dropping out . racing career open wheel racing a friend of richmond s father co owned a sprint car and richmond joined the team as a crew member for dave shoemaker . in , year old richmond took the car onto lakeville speedway at lakeville , ohio for some practice laps . somebody put a stopwatch on me , richmond said . i was running laps faster than dave had been . it was the first time i had ever driven a race car . richmond and his father found a red , white and blue colored no. car in pennsylvania , which was the same number and paint scheme that richmond used on model cars as a child . in his first competition at the track , officials placed richmond in the slowest heat . he passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle . although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction , the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight . after being towed to the pits , he parked the car for the rest of the event . later that season , they towed the car to eldora speedway , only to have richmond crash the car again . in response , richmond s father fired him as the driver . the next season , al richmond bought a supermodified better suited to his son s driving style . in tim richmond became both sandusky speedway s rookie of the year and the supermodified class track champion . richmond returned to racing sprint cars in the united states automobile club s usac national sprint car tour in . competing in races , he finished th in points as the series rookie of the year . that year he attended jim russell s road racing school at willow springs international motorsports park , setting a student course record . richmond raced in a mini indy car event at phoenix international raceway , winning the formula super vee support event in a lola t . the win attracted sponsors and attention from major owners like roger penske . he also competed in usac s silver crown series . richmond s father bought an eagle indy car chassis and an offenhauser engine for the race at michigan international speedway . richmond qualified st fastest with a . mph . km h lap , significantly slower than bobby unser s . mph . km h pole position speed . the race ended for him when his motor blew up on the fourth lap , and he finished last rd . owner pat santello was looking for a driver to replace larry rice for his cart team at the following race at watkins glen international , so he gave richmond a test at willow spring where he had previously set the student record . santello hired richmond , who then qualified th fastest for the event and finished in eighth place , the best of his indycar career . richmond raced in three more events that season . after crashing during the first day of qualifying for the indianapolis , richmond nevertheless obtained the th starting position in the race . he worked his way up to the top during the race , led a lap , and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race . to the delight of the crowd , winner johnny rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits . he was named the indianapolis rookie of the year . i busted up a few indy cars right after that , he said . milwaukee , mid ohio . . . at michigan i cut one in two . i was afraid my racing career would come to a halt . so when i got an offer to drive stock cars , i took it , and it turned out i liked driving them better . nascar pocono raceway president joseph mattioli iii convinced richmond to make the change to stock car racing on the nascar circuit . richmond made his first nascar start two months after winning the indianapolis rookie of the year award . he debuted at the coca cola at pocono on july , , finishing th in a d. k. ulrich owned chevrolet . that season , he competed in five events , with two dnfs did not finish and three th place finishes . overall , he finished the season st in points . richmond raced for three teams in . he started the season by competing in events for ulrich . he had his first career top finish , taking sixth place at talladega superspeedway , soon followed by a seventh place finish at texas world speedway . after kennie childers hired him away from ulrich mid season , richmond had top finishes at pocono and bristol . for the final seven races of the season , he drove for bob rogers and had a top finish at dover international speedway . overall for the season , richmond had six top finishes to place th in season points . richmond started without a ride before getting a one race deal to drive for billie harvey at the rockingham track . richmond completed laps of the lap event to finish st , retiring from the race with engine problems . for the following event , richmond was hired to drive j.d. stacy s no. car . in his first race for the team , richmond earned his first career top finish when he placed fifth at darlington raceway . returning to pocono , he finished second , before winning his first race on the road course at riverside , california the following week . later that season , he earned his first pole position at bristol . the tour returned to riverside for the final race of the season where richmond won his second race , sweeping both events at the track . benny parsons said that watching richmond go through the esses was unbelievable . for the season , richmond had twelve top s , two wins , and one pole to finish th in points . in , richmond began racing for raymond beadle whom he had known before he started racing . he returned to the three cornered pocono racetrack , earning his first oval victory . during the season , he accumulated four pole positions darlington , pocono , charlotte , and atlanta , one win pocono , and fifteen top s on his way to finishing tenth in season points . he made his first appearance in a nascar busch series now nationwide series car , but did not finish any of the three races he entered that season . esquire magazine named richmond as one of the best of the new generation in . that year he had one win at north wilkesboro speedway and second place finishes at dover , darlington and riverside . richmond finished the season th in points , with finishes in the top and in six in the top . in , the final season that richmond competed for beadle , his best finish was a second place run at bristol . he ended the season th in points with top s in races . in the busch series , he qualified at the pole position in the two races he entered , and won the charlotte race . richmond joined hendrick motorsports in , where he teamed up with veteran crew chief harry hyde . it took the team until the middle of the season to gel . richmond had suffered a race winless streak that was finally broken at the van scoy diamond mine at pocono in june . after two straight second place finishes at charlotte and riverside , richmond started the pocono event in third place inside the second row . that race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point . nascar wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official , so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track . it took the drivers minutes to complete the laps , and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields . two hours later , the track had dried and the race resumed with richmond in third . after richmond s car was adjusted to remove the push , the car was more to his liking . because his radio did not work , he was unable to communicate with his crew chief , hyde , and he made his final pit stop with laps left . hyde worried that richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end . after richmond took the lead with laps left in the race , dale earnhardt made up three seconds on richmond s five second lead . with four laps to go , buddy arrington spun in a three car accident . the remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and richmond took the checkered flag for the victory . he had led laps , including the final , taking his first victory in a rick hendrick car . the tour returned to pocono a month later , and richmond battled for another victory in a fog shortened event . in the final lap sprint , richmond competed in a three car battle with geoff bodine and ricky rudd . richmond crossed the finish line beside rudd , winning the race by . seconds . he notched four more victories that season , and over a span of twelve races , richmond earned three second place finishes , and six wins . the national motorsports press association named him co driver of the year with earnhardt after richmond accumulated top finishes and in the top . he had a career best third place finish in points after winning seven events in , in what was his last full nascar season . illness and death richmond fell ill the day after the nascar annual banquet during a promotional trip to new york . he was not well enough to begin the nascar season despite lengthy hospitalization in cleveland and further rest at home when richmond missed the daytona , his condition was reported as double pneumonia . media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids . he returned to pocono for the miller high life during the middle of the year . starting third , he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led laps , including the final , to win the race by eight car lengths over bill elliott . in the middle of the race , richmond s car suffered gearbox problems . because he could use only fourth high gear , he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits . richmond was emotional after the victory , saying , i had tears in my eyes when i took the checkered flag . then every time anyone congratulated me , i started bawling again . richmond earned a victory in the next race at riverside , and made his final start at michigan international speedway s champion spark plug that august , finishing th with a blown engine . he resigned from hendrick motorsports in september . although richmond attempted a comeback in , nascar suspended him for testing positive for banned substances . the substances were identified as sudafed , a non prescription over the counter allergy medication , and advil , an over the counter pain reliever . in april , richmond sued nascar over the suspension . although he retested later that year and was reinstated , he could not find a car to drive . in his final public appearance in february , richmond denied that he abused drugs and said that a mistake had been made in his drug test . his suit with nascar was settled out of court , the terms sealed . richmond withdrew into his condo in florida . there were by then rumors of hiv and aids , which he denied . he was later hospitalized in west palm beach . espn sent a get well soon card to richmond when it aired the july nascar race at pocono . the television network showed highlights of richmond s victory at the track from . tim had hollywood good looks and the charisma of tom cruise , said his friend dr. jerry punch . there he was in victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging all over him . it was important for the people at the hospital to see tim the way he really was , when he was healthy and handsome and vital , not the way he was as they saw him every day in the hospital . on august , , richmond died at the age of , about two years after his final nascar race . he was buried in ashland , ohio . the secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days . at the time , punch stated that richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident , though it is unlikely that richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months . ten days after his death , on august , the richmond family held a press conference to reveal that richmond died from complications from aids , which he acquired from an unknown woman . richmond s physician , dr. david dodson , said there s no way of knowing who that woman was . tim was a celebrity with a lot of charisma , a handsome guy . he naturally attracted a lot of women . punch later claimed that more than drivers and personnel underwent hiv testing in the wake of richmond s death . legacy in , a few months after richmond s death , washington television station wjla tv and reporter roberta baskin reported that dr. forest tennant , who was then the national football league s drug adviser , falsified drug tests that ultimately helped shorten richmond s nascar career . baskin reported that sealed court documents and interviews showed tennant and nascar used allegedly false drug test results in to bar richmond from racing . baskin also stated that nascar had targeted richmond , requesting that tennant establish a substance abuse policy with richmond in mind . a series of drug tests and falsely reported positive results shortly before the daytona kept richmond from driving in what was to have been his last big race ... , the report said . the new york times published the findings . while neither tennant nor nascar supplied an official response at the time , nascar did confirm that they were seeking to replace tennant . the ashland county sports hall of fame inducted richmond in their second class in . in , nascar named richmond one of its greatest drivers of all time . he was inducted into the international motorsports hall of fame in . the mansfield motorsports park arca re max series race in was named the tim richmond memorial arca re max in honor of the area native . the race at mansfield was co promoted by mattioli s son joseph mattioli iii . the documentary film tim richmond to the limit was produced as part of espn s for series with a premiere date of october , . motorsports career results nascar key bold pole position awarded by qualifying time . italics pole position earned by points standings or practice time . most laps led . winston cup series daytona busch series trout creek mountains the trout creek mountains are a remote , semi arid great basin mountain range mostly in southeastern oregon and partially in northern nevada in the united states . the range s highest point is orevada view benchmark , , feet , m above sea level , in nevada . disaster peak , elevation , feet , m , is another prominent summit in the nevada portion of the mountains . the mountains are characteristic of the great basin s topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys . oriented generally north to south , the trout creek mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt , which came from an ancient volcano and other vents , on top of older metamorphic rocks . the southern end of the range , however , features many granitic outcrops . as a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons . most of the range is public land administered by the federal bureau of land management . there is very little human development in the remote region cattle grazing and ranching are the primary human uses but former mines at the mcdermitt caldera produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in north america in the th century . public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited . vegetation includes large swaths of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands . sage grouse and mountain chickadee are two bird species native to the range , and common mammals include pronghorn and jackrabbits . despite the area s dry climate , a few year round streams provide habitat for the rare lahontan cutthroat trout . fish populations in the trout creek mountains declined throughout much of the th century . in the s , the effects of grazing allotments on riparian zones and the fish led to land use conflict . the trout creek mountain working group was formed in to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties . the stakeholders met and agreed on changes to land use practices , and since the early s , riparian zones have begun to recover . geography the trout creek mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern oregon and northern nevada , in harney and humboldt counties . the nearest human settlements are the whitehorse ranch , about miles km directly north from the middle of the mountains fields , oregon , about miles km to the northwest denio , nevada , about miles km to the west and mcdermitt , nevada oregon , about miles km to the east . the mountains are about miles km directly southwest of boise , idaho , and about miles km northeast of reno , nevada . the range and surrounding non mountainous areas cover an area of square miles , km . the mountains run miles km north to south and miles km east to west . more of the range is in oregon than in nevada . the highest point in the range is orevada view benchmark , which is , feet , m above sea level and is located in nevada about one mile south of the oregon border . about two miles southeast of orevada view is disaster peak , a large , symmetrical butte that is visible throughout the region . at , feet , m , disaster peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub range called the granites . the oregon canyon mountains border the trout creek mountains on the east along the harney malheur county line according to the united states geological survey s definitions , while the pueblo mountains are the next range west of the trout creek mountains . the bilk creek mountains in both oregon and nevada border the trout creek mountains on the southwest the two ranges are separated by log cabin creek and south fork cottonwood creek . south of the trout creek mountains is the kings river valley , which separates the bilk creek mountains on the west from the montana mountains on the east . the terrain in the trout creek mountains varies from broad , flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock escarpments cut by deep canyons . the canyons have steep walls with loose talus slopes at the bottoms . there are meadows around springs in the mountains , although most streams in the range do not flow year round . major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include from west to east cottonwood creek , trout creek , willow creek , and whitehorse creek . these streams all flow into endorheic basins in harney county , oregon . trout creek and whitehorse creek are the largest of the four . the kings river and mcdermitt creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the trout creek mountains . the kings river begins in the granites and flows south into nevada , where it meets the quinn river , which evaporates in the black rock desert . mcdermitt creek begins in oregon a few miles north of the granites and flows generally east , crossing the oregon nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the quinn river valley south of mcdermitt . geology the mountains lie within the basin and range province or great basin of the western united states , which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north south mountain ranges separated by wide , high desert valleys . the trout creek mountains are uplifted and tilted blocks with steep escarpments along the southern and eastern sides of the range . the southern area of the range , known as the granites , has numerous outcroppings of cretaceous age granite . these granite outcrops are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic ridgelines . the trout creek mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where steens mountain is today . crustal thinning and the yellowstone hotspot , which was then beneath southeastern oregon , induced eruptions from steens and nearby vents about million years ago , in the miocene . the vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the trout creek mountains . eruptions from the steens volcano lasted for about one million years , and at least separate lava flows occurred . under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the triassic age formations of the blue mountains in northeastern oregon . within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the cretaceous period . the broad mcdermitt caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the trout creek mountains . the oval shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the oregon nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the oregon canyon mountains . it is about miles km long and miles km wide . the lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early miocene . a total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure . the caldera formed when the dome collapsed about million years ago . the caldera contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera . other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony , cesium , and lithium . climate the trout creek mountains are semi arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west . when moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward over the oregon and california coastal ranges and the cascade range , most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the trout creek mountains . as a result , the average annual precipitation in the trout creek mountains is only to inches to mm per year , with most areas receiving between and inches and mm annually . much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of march and the end of june . most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months . snowpack at elevations below , feet , m usually melts by april however , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid june . local flooding often occurs in the spring as the snowpack melts . the prevailing winds are from the west southwest , and they are normally strongest in march and april . brief , intense thunderstorms are common between april and october . thunderstorms in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes . ecology flora vegetation in the trout creek mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses . other common shrubs include bitterbrush , snowberry , and ceanothus . there are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas . common grass species include idaho fescue , bluebunch wheatgrass , cheatgrass , western needlegrass , sandberg s bluegrass , thurber s needlegrass , and bottlebrush squirreltail , as well as basin wildrye in some well drained areas . less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian greenways vegetation along stream banks . however , these areas are vital to the local ecosystem . the meadows surround springs , which are mostly on gently sloping uplands or in stream bottoms , and range in size from about to acres . to . ha . narrow riparian greenways follow the year round streams . many greenway areas have quaking aspen and willow groves . cottonwood and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is flatter and stream channels are wider . sedges and rushes are also native to these stream bottoms . years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young aspen and willow trees . restoration of riparian areas began in the early s , and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the s and early s . however , large wildfires in southeastern oregon during the summer of burned much of the range s vegetation , damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle . fauna animals in the trout creek mountains are adapted to the environment of the high desert . pronghorn are common in the open , sagebrush covered basins , while mule deer live in the cottonwood and willow groves . there are also bighorn sheep , cougars , and bobcats in the high country . jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range . mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they roam the great basin . some other mammals include the northern pocket gopher , mountain cottontail , and belding s ground squirrel . north american beavers live in and along streams , as do pacific tree frogs , western spadefoot toads , and garter snakes . native bird species include the sage grouse , mountain chickadee , gray headed junco , black throated gray warbler , virginia s warbler , macgillivray s warbler , pine siskin , red crossbill , bushtit , hermit thrush , northern goshawk , and species of raven and eagle . several streams in the trout creek mountains are home to trout , including the rare lahontan cutthroat trout subspecies . these include willow creek , whitehorse creek , little whitehorse creek , doolittle creek , fifteen mile creek , indian creek , sage canyon creek , line canyon creek , and some tributaries of mcdermitt creek . lahontan cutthroat trout live in small , isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams , many of them in the trout creek mountains . these populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation . for most of the th century , the trout s numbers declined considerably . it was listed under federal law as an endangered species in and was reclassified as threatened in . reasons for the fish s decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , overfishing , competition with other fish , and hybridization with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased the number of genetically pure lahontan cutthroat trout . however , reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zones since the s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover . human uses the bureau of land management blm administers most land in the trout creek mountains , but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area . the private lands are mainly used for ranching along mountain streams , while the blm lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers cattle . at least mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since , some of which were staked for gold exploration . commercial mining has occurred in some areas , mostly near the mcdermitt caldera , where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted . mines in what was called the opalite mining district produced , flasks of mercury the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the th century . the two leading mercury producing mines in north america were the cordero and mcdermitt mines on the edge of the caldera in nevada . together , they operated from to . the mcdermitt mine , the last mercury mine in the united states , closed three years later , in . however , mineral exploration has continued at the cordero mine in the st century , and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of mcdermitt as part of a u.s. environmental protection agency cleanup project . the entire mountain range is very remote as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness like experience . camping , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities . the only developed recreation site nearby is at willow creek hot springs , just south of the whitehorse ranch , where nearby there are miles of trails designated for four wheel off road vehicles . hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , pronghorn , chukars , and rabbits . fishing on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch and release basis . the mountains are also suitable for hiking cross country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek bottoms . there are more than archaeological sites in the range that document use by northern paiute people as long as , years ago . cattle grazing in the trout creek mountains began in the late th century , and the blm currently oversees grazing allotments in the area . cattle can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months . the effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the s . land management compromise by the s and s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the trout creek mountains and elsewhere in the great basin . as a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones . aspen populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures . these conditions put the rare lahontan cutthroat trout population at risk . since the lahontan was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the trout creek mountains . beginning in the early s , the bureau of land management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas . approximately , willow trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing . next , the agency sought to reform land use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project . as environmentalists pressed the blm to close much of the trout creek mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the sagebrush rebellion seeking to protect their grazing allotments . initially , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades . however , in , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the trout creek mountain working group . the group s goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone a plan that would protect both the land s ecological health and ranchers economic needs . initial members of the trout creek mountain working group included over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers . meetings were all open to the public . the group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well being of ranchers . in , the whitehorse ranch agreed to rest two grazing allotments totaling , acres , ha to restore critical stream greenways and mountain pastures . the ranch s allotment on fifteen mile creek was rested for three years , and its willow creek pasture received a five year rest before grazing was resumed . in addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , and the total number of cattle released in the allotment areas was reduced from , to , . finally , sensitive areas were fenced to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams . other ranches also agreed to rest specific pastures including the trout creek , cottonwood creek , and whitehorse butte allotments . in , the bureau of land management approved a new grazing allotment management plan . it was based on the agreements made by the trout creek mountain working group , and it took effect in . since then , vegetation in riparian areas of the trout creek mountains has recovered , and studies by the united states fish and wildlife service have found that the lahontan cutthroat trout population , still listed as threatened , is also recovering . mycena inclinata mycena inclinata , commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak stump bonnet cap , is a species of mushroom in the family mycenaceae . the doubtfully edible mushroom has a reddish brown bell shaped cap up to . cm . in in diameter . the thin stem is up to cm . in tall , whitish to yellow brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish brown towards the base in maturity , where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem . the gills are pale brown to pinkish , and the spore print is white . it is a widespread saprobic fungus , and has been found in europe , north africa , asia , australasia , and north america , where it grows in small groups or tufts on fallen logs and stumps , especially of oak . british mycologist e.j.h. corner has described two varieties of the mushroom from borneo . lookalike species with which m. inclinata may be confused include m. galericulata and m. maculata . taxonomy , phylogeny , and naming first described as agaricus inclinatus by swedish mycologist elias magnus fries in , it was assigned its current name in by lucien qulet . mycena galericulata var. calopus named by karsten in , and its basionym agaricus galericulatus var. calopus named by fries in , are synonyms . in a molecular study of the large subunit ribosomal dna sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the orchid gastrodia confusa , m. inclinata was found to be closely related to m. aurantiomarginata , m. crocata , and m. leaiana . the specific epithet inclinata means bent in . the mushroom is commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak stump bonnet cap . description the cap is light reddish brown , with a diameter typically ranging from to . cm . to . in . initially conic to bell shaped to convex , it flattens during maturity , developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap . the margin of the cap has minute but distinct scallops . the surface is moist and smooth , and hygrophanous . the cap frequently develops splits in the margin , or cracks in the disc the central part of the cap . the flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere , grayish to whitish , fragile , and with a slightly mealy odor and taste . the gills have a decurrent attachment to the stem that is , running down the length of the stem and are a pale brownish color with tinges of red . they are broad between and mm , and have a close to subdistant spacing , with about gills reaching the stem . the fragile stem is to cm . to . in long by . to . cm . to . in thick and yellow to yellow brown , becoming reddish brown to orange brown in the bottom half in maturity . the lower portion of young stems is covered with white flecks . roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom , the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem . the edibility of the mushroom is doubtful and consumption best avoided . microscopic characteristics the spores are by . m , broadly ellipsoid , smooth , and strongly amyloid it turns black when treated with melzer s reagent . the basidia spore bearing cells are four spored . the pleurocystidia cystidia on the gill face are not differentiated . the cheilocystidia cystidia on the gill edge are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous , club shaped , by m , and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick . the flesh of the gills is homogeneous , and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine . the flesh of the cap has a distinct pellicle , a well differentiated hypoderm a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle , and a filamentous tramal body gill tissue it is pale yellowish to sordid brownish in iodine stain . varieties e.j.h. corner defined the varieties m. inclinata var. kinabaluensis and var. subglobospora in his publication on agaric mushrooms of malesia , a biogeographical region straddling the boundary of the indomalaya and australasia ecozones . the variety kinabaluensis named after its type locality , kinabalu has a cap margin that is not scalloped , little or no odor , and cheilocystidia with shorter processes . it was found growing on the dead wood of lithocarpus havilandii , a stone oak tree in the beech family . variety subglobospora , found in sabah , has spores that are almost spherical . similar species mycena maculata bears some resemblance to m. inclinata , but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps , and is found in eastern north america , and sometimes on oak on the west coast . in age , it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in m. inclinata . m. inclinata is often confused with the edible m. galericulata , a common species that is variable in cap color , size and shape . m. galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray brown , and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross veins . m. polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish gray . habitat and distribution mycena inclinata is a saprobic fungus , deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves , twigs , bark and branches . it accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter cellulose , hemicellulose and lignin . the fruit bodies of mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps especially oak and chestnut during the spring and autumn . the fungus forms a white , woolly mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves . occasionally , it can be found growing on a living tree . in eastern north america , it is abundant in the area bounded by nova scotia , ontario , manitoba , missouri , north carolina , and new york . it has been found in oregon , but the species appears to be generally rare along the pacific coast . the range of the fungus also includes europe , the canary islands , north africa , east siberia , japan , malesia , turkey , and new zealand . chemistry in a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in ordu turkey , m. inclinata was found to have comparatively high levels of iron mg per kg and nickel . mg kg , measured on a dry weight basis . laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum . the fungus has been investigated for its ability to decolorize synthetic dyes that are used in the textile , plastics , biomedical and foodstuff industries . the dyes are not readily biodegradable , and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic . capel lligwy capel lligwy sometimes referred to as hen gapel lligwy is a ruined chapel near rhos lligwy in anglesey , north wales , dating back to the first half of the th century . the chapel s original purpose is unknown , but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court , or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population . it was used for a time until the early th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house , then later fell into disrepair . the walls still remain , with some traces of render on them internally , but there is no roof . it contains a th century side chapel with a vault beneath , used as a burial chamber . it is a grade ii listed building , a national designation given to buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them , in particular because it is a substantially th century structure with the unusual th century vaulted south chapel . history and location the oldest parts of capel lligwy date from the first half of the th century . this was a time when many churches on anglesey in north west wales were first built in stone following the end of viking raids and attempts by the normans to gain control of the island . the reason for its construction , and the saint to whom it was dedicated , are unknown . geraint jones , author of a guide to the churches of anglesey , suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel , or connected to a royal court nearby . yates and longley , authors of a guide to ancient anglesey monuments , note that it was built in the large parish of penrhos lligwy and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times . despite this , it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right . the chapel is sometimes referred to as hen gapel lligwy hen being the welsh word for old and capel meaning chapel . the walls were partially rebuilt in the th century , and the upper parts of the walls date from this time . a chapel was added to the south side of the building in the th century . a vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family , the pierce lloyds . in , the vault was used to record some atmospheres for the album you have just been poisoned by the serpents by the serpents , a collective of welsh musicians including members of echo and the bunnymen , super furry animals and ectogram that was described by one journalist as possibly the strangest pop group of all time . for a time , capel lligwy was used as a private place of worship for lligwy house , a venerable mansion once owned by the lloyd family which came into the possession of william irby , st baron boston , in the th century . after the early part of the th century , however , the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair . the walls remain to gable level , with some traces of render on the inside , but the roof has gone . capel lligwy is in the anglesey countryside near llanallgo the parish church of st gallgo , llanallgo is about . miles . km away . part of the churchyard wall remains , showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure , as often found with early churches . it is cared for by cadw , the welsh assembly government body responsible for the built heritage of wales , and is open to the public . architecture and fittings capel lligwy is built from rubble masonry at about feet . m up the walls , the style changes and smaller stones are inserted into spaces between the larger blocks , showing where the th century rebuilding started . the doorway is on the south side , headed by a plain arch , and dates from the th century . there is a stone bellcote at the west end . there is no structural division between the nave where the congregation would have sat and the chancel where the altar would have been located . there are no window openings on the north side , but there is a blocked opening to the east about feet . m wide and there are the remains of a window on the south wall . there is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel . the vault , which is about square feet . m , is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel . limestone slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above . a stone in the nave , about square feet . m with a hole in the top , might once have been used as a churchyard cross . assessment capel lligwy has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a grade ii listed building the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them . it was given this status on september and has been listed because it is important as a substantially th century structure , with some architectural details surviving from this early period , even though it is now in a ruinous condition . cadw which is responsible for the inclusion of welsh buildings on the statutory lists also notes the unusual th century vaulted south chapel . the th century antiquarian angharad llwyd mentioned the church in her history of anglesey . she said that the architecture was of the rudest kind , which bears testimony to its great antiquity . she recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins , and when it was dug out , the vault was discovered , containing several human skeletons , which crumbled into dust , when exposed to the air . she added that further exploration of the vault then revealed a large mass of human bones , several feet in depth . a book about abandoned churches in wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of anglesey , and calls capel lligwy a medieval gesture of christian power in a land so obviously imbued with the spirit of a pagan past . it notes that the wheel has turned full circle and capel lligwy today is just another ruined relic of a former age . the authors describe the chapel as a simple , square building with a small and ruggedly austere south chapel , adding that the stone slabs over the vault are almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape . michigan wolverines men s basketball team the michigan wolverines men s basketball team

distinguish it from the red dwarf upsilon andromedae b , also named saffar , is an extrasolar planet approximately light years away from the sun in the constellation of andromeda . the planet orbits the solar twin star , upsilon andromedae a , approximately every five days . discovered in june by geoffrey marcy and r. paul butler , it was one of the first hot jupiters to be discovered . it is also one of the first non resolved planets to be detected directly . upsilon andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system . in july the international astronomical union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . the process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . in december , the iau announced the winning name was saffar for this planet . the winning name was submitted by the vega astronomy club of morocco and honours the th century astronomer ibn al saffar of muslim spain . discovery like the majority of known extrasolar planets , upsilon andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star s radial velocity caused by the planet s gravity . the variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the doppler shift of upsilon andromedae s spectrum . the planet s existence was announced in january , together with cancri b and the planet orbiting tau botis . like pegasi b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , upsilon andromedae b orbits very close to its star , closer than mercury does to our sun . the planet takes . days to complete an orbit , with a semimajor axis of . au . a limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect upsilon andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found . in the case of upsilon andromedae b , this lower limit is . of the mass of jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater . however , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around and the true mass may be about . mj . coplanarity is not to be assumed the mutual inclination between c and d is degrees . physical characteristics given the planet s high mass , it is likely that upsilon andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface . the spitzer space telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the two sides of upsilon andromedae b of about , degrees celsius , ranging from minus to degrees to about , to , degrees celsius . the temperature difference has led to speculation that upsilon andromedae b is tidal locked with the same side always facing upsilon andromedae a. sudarsky had , on the assumption that the planet is similar to jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium , predicted upsilon andromedae b to have reflective clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere . the cloud deck instead absorbs the sun s radiation between that and the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a stratosphere of cooler gas . the outer shell of dark , opaque , hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides pm planets , but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet . the planet is unlikely to have large moons , since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system . the planet with pegasi b was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by planetpol . preliminary results from polarimetric studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is . times as large and . times as massive as jupiter , meaning that the mean density is .g cm . it has a geometric albedo of . in visible light . effect on its sun upsilon andromedae b appears to be responsible for increased chromospheric activity on its parent star . observations suggest that there is a hot spot on the star around away from the sub planetary point . this may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star . the mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of rs canum venaticorum variable stars , or the interaction between jupiter and its moon io . daniel radcliffe daniel jacob radcliffe born july is an english actor who rose to prominence as the title character in the harry potter film series . he made his acting debut at years of age in bbc one s television film david copperfield , followed by his cinematic debut in s the tailor of panama . at age , he was cast as harry potter in the first harry potter film , and starred in the series for years until the release of the eighth and final film in . radcliffe began to branch out to stage acting in , starring in the london and new york productions of equus , and in the broadway revival of the musical how to succeed in business without really trying . he starred in the horror film the woman in black , and played beat poet allen ginsberg in the independent film kill your darlings . he has contributed to many charities , including demelza hospice care for children , and the trevor project for suicide prevention among lgbtq youth , which gave him its hero award in . early life radcliffe was born in west london , england . he is the only child of alan george radcliffe , a literary agent , and marcia jeannine gresham ne marcia gresham jacobson , a casting agent who was involved in several films for the bbc , including the inspector lynley mysteries and walk away and i stumble . his father , who was raised in banbridge , county down , northern ireland , is from a very working class protestant background . his mother is jewish , and was born in south africa and raised in westcliff on sea , essex . her family had originally come from poland and russia . radcliffe s parents had both acted as children . in a interview , radcliffe stated there was never religious faith in the house . i think of myself as being jewish and irish , despite the fact that i m english . he has stated we were christmas tree jews , and that he is very proud of being jewish . radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at the age of five , and in december , aged , he made his acting debut in bbc one s televised two part adaptation of the charles dickens novel david copperfield , portraying the title character as a young boy . he was educated at two independent schools for boys sussex house school , a day school in chelsea s cadogan square , and the city of london school , a day school on the north bank of the river thames in london s financial district known as the city of london . attending school became difficult for radcliffe after the release of the first harry potter film , with some fellow pupils becoming hostile , though he says it was people just trying to have a crack at the kid that plays harry potter rather than jealousy . as his acting career began to consume his schedule , radcliffe continued his education through on set tutors . he admitted he was not very good at school , considering it useless and finding the work really difficult . he achieved a grades in the three as level exams that he took in , but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university . part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write , and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience . the paparazzi , they d love it , he told details magazine in . if there were any parties going on , they d be tipped off as to where they were . career harry potter in , producer david heyman asked radcliffe to audition for the role of harry potter for the film adaptation of harry potter and the philosopher s stone , the best selling book by british author j. k. rowling . rowling had been searching for an unknown british actor to personify the character , and the movie s director chris columbus recalled thinking , this is what i want . this is harry potter , after he saw a video of the young actor in david copperfield . eight months later , and after several auditions , radcliffe was selected to play the part . rowling also endorsed the selection saying , i don t think chris columbus could have found a better harry . radcliffe s parents originally turned down the offer , as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in los angeles . warner bros. instead offered radcliffe a two movie contract with shooting in the uk radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that . the release of harry potter and the philosopher s stone released as harry potter and the sorcerer s stone in the united states took place in . radcliffe received a seven figure salary for the lead role , but asserted that the fee was not that important to him his parents chose to invest the money for him . the film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews , and critics took notice of radcliffe radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader s imagination . it is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions , from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing , wrote bob graham of the san francisco chronicle . a year later radcliffe starred in harry potter and the chamber of secrets , the second installment of the series . reviewers were positive about the lead actors performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole . the release harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was the third film in the series . radcliffe s performance was panned by new york times journalist a. o. scott , who wrote that watson had to carry him with her performance . next was harry potter and the goblet of fire in . the film was the second highest grossing harry potter film at that point , and radcliffe singled out the humour as being a reason for the movie s creative success . the future of the franchise was put into question when radcliffe and his co leads emma watson and rupert grint hesitated signing on to continue their roles for the final two episodes however , by march radcliffe had signed for the final films , which put an end to weeks of press speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in equus , in which he had performed nude on stage . radcliffe reprised his role for the fourth time in harry potter and the order of the phoenix . radcliffe stated that director david yates and actress imelda staunton made order of the phoenix the most fun film in the series to work on . his performance earned several award nominations , and he received the national movie award for best male performance . as his fame and the series continued , radcliffe , grint , and watson left imprints of their hands , feet , and wands in front of grauman s chinese theatre in hollywood . in july harry potter and the half blood prince was released , the series sixth

lambertville and newark was removed in favor of u.s. route between lambertville and somerville and u.s. route between somerville and newark . the section of former route between route a and route s became route . plans for a limited access route along the route corridor go back to , when a parkway was proposed along the delaware river between trenton and lambertville this proposal never materialized . plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early s to construct a road , the john fitch parkway , that was to run from hamilton township to interstate in ewing township . this road was built between and from south warren street in trenton to present day interstate in ewing township . construction of this portion john fitch parkway took up much of trenton s available waterfront along the delaware river . the former alignment of route in the northern part of trenton and in ewing township became route . between and , the route freeway was built between the interstate interstate interchange and route in hamilton township . a two lane street , lamberton road , connected the two freeway sections . plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in trenton . construction began in on the route freeway between route and the morrisville trenton railroad bridge . the road was to include two traffic lights at cass street and south warren street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the delaware river . the tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by but was delayed after the army corps of engineers discovered many

concurrent with route . major intersections first mongol invasion of burma the first mongol invasions of burma myanmar burmese were a series of military conflicts between kublai khan s yuan dynasty , division of the mongol empire , and the pagan empire that took place between and . the invasions toppled the year old pagan empire , and the mongol army seized pagan territories in present day dehong , yunnan and northern burma to tagaung . the invasions ushered in years of political fragmentation in burma and the rise of tai shan states throughout mainland southeast asia . the mongols first demanded tribute from pagan in , as part of their drive to encircle the song dynasty of china . when king narathihapate refused , emperor kublai khan himself sent another mission in , again demanding tribute . it too was rejected . in , the emperor ordered the yunnan government to secure the borderlands in order to block an escape path for the song , and permitted a limited border war if pagan contested . pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the mongol army in . after a brief lull , kublai khan in turned his attention to southeast asia , demanding tribute from pagan , the khmer empire , i vit and champa . when the burmese king again refused , the emperor ordered an invasion of northern burma . two dry season campaigns later , the mongols had occupied down to tagaung and hanlin , forcing the burmese king to flee to lower burma . the mongols organized northern burma as the province of zhengmian . ceasefire negotiations began in , and ended with narathihapate finally agreeing to submit in june . the burmese embassy , received by the emperor in beijing in january , agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the suzerainty of the yuan dynasty or the mongol empire over the pagan empire and annual payments in taxes to the yunnan government in exchange for the evacuation of mongol troops from northern burma . but the treaty never really took effect as narathihapate was assassinated in july , and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged . the mongol command at yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void , and ordered an invasion of central burma . they may not have reached pagan , and even if they did , after having suffered heavy casualties , they returned to tagaung . the pagan empire disintegrated and anarchy ensued . the mongols , who probably preferred the situation , did nothing to restore order in the next ten years . in march , they accepted the voluntary submission of king kyawswa of pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of pagan bagan . but kyawswa was overthrown nine months later , and the mongols were forced to intervene , leading to their second invasion in . marco polo reported the first invasions in his travelogue , il milione . the burmese referred to the invaders as the taruk after the central asian turkic troops that largely made up the mongol invasion army today , the term taruk refers to the han chinese instead . king narathihapate is unkindly remembered in burmese history as taruk pye min , the king who fled from the taruk . background pagan and dali in the th century , the pagan empire , along with the khmer empire , was one of the two main empires in mainland southeast asia . for much of its history , pagan s neighbor to the northeast was not china but the independent dali kingdom and its predecessor nanzhao , both with dali as their capital city . dali based kingdoms were a power in their own right , at times allying themselves with the tibetan empire to their west and at other times with china s tang and song dynasties . indeed , nanzhao s mounted armies ventured deep into what is today burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of pagan and the pagan dynasty itself . between the newly conquered mongol territory and pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present day dehong , baoshan and lincang prefectures in yunnan as well as the wa and palaung regions presumably in present day northern shan state , which pagan and dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence . then as now , the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges . mongol conquest of dali the mongol empire first arrived at the doorstep of the pagan empire in by invading the dali kingdom in its attempt to outflank song china . the mongol armies captured the capital , dali , on january , and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by . the arrival of the mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the mongols were intent on finishing off the song . for the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from china to burma and india . the mongols set up military garrisons , manned mostly by turkic speaking muslims from central asia , in circuits of the former dali kingdom . decline of pagan by then , the pagan empire , despite outward appearances of calm , had been in long and slow decline since the early th century . the continuous growth of tax free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom . the crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges . although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in in south arakan and martaban mottama , the decline continued . on the eve of the mongol invasions , between one and two thirds of upper burma s cultivable land had been donated to religion . the crown s ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy . prelude to war first mongol mission the period of calm for pagan ended in the early s . by then , the song were on the ropes , and emperor kublai khan , who officially founded the yuan dynasty on december , sought to cut off the retreat of song refugees in all directions . in pagan s case , he had ordered the mongol governor of dali to tighten control of the borderlands , and in january to send a mission to pagan to demand tribute . the tribute he demanded was nominal . given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at pagan . at the border , the ruler of the wa and palaung regions submitted to the mongols . when the mongol envoys led by qidai tuoyin showed up , the pagan court led by chief minister ananda pyissi was well aware of the military power of the mongols and advised king narathihapate to use diplomacy . the king was furious at the demand and kept the mongol envoys waiting for weeks . the court finally devised a compromise the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king . accompanying them was a burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the burmese king s wish to one day worship a buddha tooth at beijing . the king then promptly ordered an expedition , which retook the rebellious borderland regions in april . the rebel leader a pi was brought back to pagan . dali relayed the news to beijing but did not carry out any military action . second mongol mission at beijing , kublai khan , who was preparing an invasion of japan , decided against a war with pagan for the time being . on march , he sent a member delegation led by an imperial ambassador , the first secretary to the board rites , to pagan . the delegation carried a letter from the emperor . the letter says if you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the all highest , send one of your brothers or senior ministers , to show men that all the world is linked with us , and enter into a perpetual alliance . this will add to your reputation , and be in your own interests for if it comes to war , who will be the victor ponder well , o king , our words . this time , the burmese king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit . the burmese chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed . but both burmese inscriptional evidence and yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed . at any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to yunnan in due time . the newly formed yunnan government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route . mongol consolidation of borderlands meanwhile , in , the former dali kingdom was officially reorganized as the province of yunnan , with sayyid ajjal shams al din omar as governor . in may , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned that the burmese evidently had no intention of submitting and that war was the only way forward . but the emperor rejected an outright invasion . just coming off a disastrous japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair . he was now focused on delivering the final blow against the song the emperor ordered the yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the song refugees . he also sanctioned a limited border war if pagan contested the takeover . as planned , the yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in . elsewhere , the main mongol armies had captured most of the song territory by . by , at least one burmese vassal state named gold teeth modern yingjiang had submitted to the mongols . like in , the burmese government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state but unlike in , the mongols had posted a sizable garrison there . though it was ultimately under mongol command , many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were turkic speaking peoples or people from the further west turks from samarkand , bukhara , merv and nishapur , but also captive soldiers from the persian khwarazmid empire , the kipchaks , and even bulgars from the lower volga . border war what followed was a border war in . it was reported mainly in the yuan dynasty chronicle and the travelogue of marco polo . although the burmese chronicles have no record of the border war , a burmese inscription mentions the army s defeat at ngasaunggyan . the mongol accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate . battle of ngasaunggyan according to the yuan dynasty chronicle and marco polo s accounts , a burmese army invaded the mongol territory of gold teeth , and was defeated by the mongol army in april . the battle took place either at the vochang valley in present day baoshan prefecture or km southwest at kanngai present day yingjiang , dehong prefecture , which the burmese called ngasaunggyan . the yuan chronicle reports that only men defeated a burmese army of , to , with , horses and elephants . it also reports only one mongol was killed , in trying to catch an elephant . according to marco polo , the mongol army consisted of , mounted archers , and the burmese army numbered , men with elephants , on each of which was set a tower of timber , well framed and strong , and carrying from to well armed fighting men . even then , the , to , figures of the burmese army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high the mongols may have erred on the side of generosity not to diminish their glory in defeating superior numbers . according to marco polo s account , in the early stages of the battle , the turkish and mongol horsemen took such fright at the sight of the elephants that they would not be got to face the foe , but always swerved and turned back , while the burmese forces pressed on . but the mongol commander huthukh did not panic he ordered his troops to dismount , and from the cover of the nearby treeline , aim their bows directly at the advancing elephants . the mongol archers arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled . raid of kaungsin the mongol army pressed on after the monsoon season . in the following dry season of , c . december , a mongol army of led by nasr al din , son of gov. sayyid ajjal , advanced to kaungsin , which defended the bhamo pass . they occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned stockades . but they found the heat excessive and returned . interlude despite the mongol military success , the control of the borderlands remained contested . pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions , and the burmese , apparently taking advantage of mongol preoccupations elsewhere , rebuilt their forts at kaungsin and ngasaunggyan later in , posting permanent garrisons commanded by einda pyissi . but their control was short lived . the great khan s attention turned to southeast asia once more in . he had had mixed success his vaunted forces had finished off the last of the song in but had again failed to take japan in . that year , the mongol emperor sent another mission to pagan , demanding tribute yet again . the burmese king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor s court . with champa , the emperor summoned the king of champa himself to beijing . at pagan , narathihapate deliberated with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit . the burmese court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern burma . he also ordered an invasion of champa , whose king too had refused to submit . the burmese king s troubles did not go unnoticed elsewhere in the kingdom . in the same year , a usurper named wareru seized the southern port city of martaban mottama by killing its pagan appointed governor . although the king s three sons were viceroys of the nearby lower burma cities in bassein pathein , prome pyay , and dala , the king , preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north , did not or could not take any action on martaban . throughout , the mongol command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of champa and northern burma . the objective of the burma campaign was to take over northern burma but no further the emperor did not sanction an attack on pagan itself . at least one army consisted of , men of the erstwhile persian khwarezmid empire under the command of yalu beg was sent to yunnan to reinforce the burma invasion force , which again was made up of turks and other central asians . on the burmese side , the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals , he probably could not have raised a large one . by mid , a burmese army led by generals ananda pyissi and yanda pyissi was deployed at a fort at ngasaunggyan . invasion battle of ngasaunggyan the invasion began on september . prince sangqudar was the commander in chief of the invasion force his deputies were vice governor taipn , and commander yagan tegin . the mongol armies marched to the border in two columns . one column advanced along the taping river using over boats the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the burmese fort at ngasaunggyan . the burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated . the chronicles say that the burmese army numbered , men while the mongol army numbered million men and million horses . the burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on december . invasion of northern burma the defeat at ngasaunggyan broke the back of burmese defenses . the burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders . kaungsin , the next fort inline , fell just six days later on december . the mongol sources say that the burmese lost , men at kaungsin . the mongol armies pushed farther south into the irrawaddy valley . they took the ancient burmese capital of tagaung , about km north of pagan on february . there , the invaders paused their advance . they found the heat of the searing irrawaddy valley excessive , and evacuated tagaung , allowing the burmese to return to tagaung on may . but the mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season . they retook tagaung , and defeated another burmese stand south of tagaung , probably near hanlin , on january , opening the way to pagan , about km south . after the defeat , the king panicked , and fled to lower burma . the evacuation proved premature . the mongol forces did not advance on pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan . the country fell into chaos . in lower burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack . although his sons ruled the key lower burma ports prome , dala and bassein , the king did not trust any of them , and he and his court settled at hlegya , west of prome . without the full support of his sons , the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one . the governor of pegu revolted that same year . the king managed to send two small expeditions to pegu but they both failed . now , the entire eastern half of lower burma pegu and martaban was in open revolt . peace negotiations ceasefire given his precarious position , narathihapate decided to buy time , and sue for peace with the mongols . in november december , the king ordered his generals ananda pyissi and maha bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations . the mongol commanders at hanlin , who had organized northern burma as a protectorate named zhengmian chinese wade giles cheng mien , agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission . they repeated their demand that the burmese king send a formal delegation to the emperor . the two sides had reached a tentative agreement by march , which calls for a full submission of the pagan empire , and central burma to be organized as the province of mianzhong chinese wade giles mien chung . after a long deliberation , the king agreed to submit but wanted the mongol troops to withdraw . in june , he sent an embassy led by shin ditha pamauk , a learned monk , to the emperor s court . treaty of beijing in january , the embassy arrived at beijing , and was received by the yuan emperor . the burmese delegation formally acknowledged mongol suzerainty of their kingdom , and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country . indeed , the tribute was no longer nominal . in exchange , the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops . for the emperor , the burma campaign was the only bright spot his other southeast asian expeditions had gone badly . he did not want to invest more troops pacify the rest of the kingdom . he preferred a vassal ruler . the burmese embassy arrived back at hlegya in may , and reported the terms to the king . breakdown but the agreement broke down a month later . in late june , the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for pagan . but on july , the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son thihathu , the viceroy of prome . anarchy ensued . each region in the country which had not revolted broke away . no successor to narathihapate , who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of beijing , emerged . indeed , a king would not emerge until may . mongol intervention given the chaos , the governor of yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation . the mongol army commanded by prince ye sin timour , a grandson of the emperor , marched south toward pagan . according to mainstream traditional british colonial era scholarship , the mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate fought its way down to pagan with the loss of men occupied the city and sent out detachments to receive homage , one of which reached south of prome . but not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary mongol chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest . recent research shows that the mongol forces most probably never reached pagan . they were held at bay by the burmese defenses led by commanders athinkhaya , yazathingyan and thihathu , and probably never got closer than km north of pagan . an inscription dated february by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the mongol army . even if the mongols did reach pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . at any rate , the mongol army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to tagaung . they remained there as the treaty was now void . aftermath the disintegration of the pagan empire was now complete . but the mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created . they would send no more expeditions to restore order . the emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to pacify the fragmented country . indeed , his real aim all along may have been to keep the entire region of southeast asia broken and fragmented . it would be another two years until one of narathihapate s sons , kyawswa , emerged as king of pagan in may . but the new king controlled just a small area around the capital , and had no real army . the real power in central burma now rested with the three commander brothers . the uneasy arrangement would persist until . the mongols continued to occupy northern burma to tagaung as the province of zhengmian cheng mien but ended the fictional central burma province of mianzhong on august . meanwhile , the power struggle in central burma continued with the three brothers blatantly consolidating support . to check their rising power , kyawswa submitted to the mongols in january , and was recognized by the yuan emperor temr khan as king of pagan on march . the emperor also gave chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of kyawswa . the brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power . on december , the three brothers overthrew kyawswa , and founded the myinsaing kingdom . the dethronement forced the mongol government to intervene again , leading to the second mongol invasion of burma . the invasion failed . two years later , on april , the mongols abolished the province of zhengmian cheng mien , evacuated tagaung , and returned to yunnan . legacy the war was one of several near simultaneous wars waged by the mongol empire and the yuan dynasty in the late th century . though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the mongols , the war set off a series of enduring developments in burma . the invasions ushered in a period of political fragmentation , and the rise of tai shan states throughout mainland southeast asia . age of political fragmentation the immediate result of the war was the collapse of the pagan empire . however , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it . pagan s disintegration was in fact more prolonged and agonized . the kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early th century . had pagan possessed a stronger central government , the collapse could have been temporary , and the country could have risen again . but the dynasty could not recover , and because the mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath . as a result , several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the th century . it was only in the late th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the irrawaddy basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy . the vast region surrounding the irrawaddy valley would continue to be made up of several small tai shan states well into the th century . rise of tai shan states perhaps the most enduring legacy of the mongol invasions was the emergence of tai shan states in mainland southeast asia . the tai shan people who came down with the mongol invasions stayed . by the early th century , several tai shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present day assam to northern and eastern myanmar to northern and central thailand and laos . their rise was encouraged by the mongols , who viewed the states as a useful buffer between yunnan and the rest of southeast asia . the mongols , who were still trying to incorporate yunnan into the central administration , were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of yunnan into the fold . the integration of yunnan itself into china proper was to take several more centuries , and continues to today . as such , from the newly formed tai shan states in western and central southeast asia to dai viet and champa in eastern southeast asia , the mongols elected to receive nominal tribute . though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the yuan government , they were the native chieftains , who would have ruled there in any case , and they did as they pleased . arrival of china on the burmese border the war also marked the arrival of china at the doorstep of burma . the old dali kingdom , known to the burmese as gandalarit , after gandhara raj was now a mongol chinese province . the burmese now called the new powers at yunnan taruk after the turkic speaking soldiers of yunnan . over the years , the term taruk came to be used to refer to the han chinese . today , king narathihapate is remembered as taruk pye min , the king who fled from the taruk chinese . from a geopolitical standpoint , the mongol chinese presence in yunnan pushed the shan migrations in the direction of burma and parts of the khmer empire . the raids by various shan states into upper burma would continue until the mid th century . mongolia myanmar relations during the official visit by the president tsakhiagiin elbegdorj to myanmar in november , aung san suu kyi , the chairperson of national league for democracy , said this was the first ever mongol mission since the mongols came years earlier . battle of edson s ridge the battle of edson s ridge , also known as the battle of the bloody ridge , battle of raiders ridge , and battle of the ridge , was a land battle of the pacific campaign of world war ii between imperial japanese army and allied mainly united states marine corps ground forces . it took place from september , on guadalcanal in the solomon islands , and was the second of three separate major japanese ground offensives during the guadalcanal campaign . in the battle , u.s. marines , under the overall command of u.s. major general alexander vandegrift , repulsed an attack by the japanese th infantry brigade , under the command of japanese major general kiyotake kawaguchi . the marines were defending the lunga perimeter that guarded henderson field on guadalcanal , which was captured from the japanese by the allies in landings on guadalcanal on august . kawaguchi s unit was sent to guadalcanal in response to the allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the allied forces from the island . underestimating the strength of allied forces on guadalcanal about , kawaguchi s , soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the u.s. defenses . the main japanese assault occurred around lunga ridge south of henderson field , manned by troops from several u.s. marine corps units , primarily troops from the st raider and st parachute battalions under u.s. marine corps lieutenant colonel merritt a. edson . although the marine defenses were almost overrun , kawaguchi s attack was ultimately defeated , with heavy losses for the japanese . because of the key participation by edson s unit in defending the ridge , the ridge was commonly referred to as edson s ridge in historical accounts of the battle in western sources . after edson s ridge , the japanese continued to send troops to guadalcanal for further attempts to retake henderson field , affecting japanese offensive operations in other areas of the south pacific . background guadalcanal campaign on august , allied forces primarily u.s. landed on guadalcanal , tulagi , and florida islands in the solomon islands . the landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the u.s. and australia . they were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major japanese base at rabaul and support the allied new guinea campaign . the landings initiated the six month long guadalcanal campaign . taking the japanese by surprise , by nightfall on august the allied landing forces had secured tulagi and nearby small islands , as well as an airfield under construction at lunga point s e on the north shore of the island of guadalcanal east of the present day capital of honiara . vandegrift placed his , troops of the st marine division on guadalcanal in a loose perimeter around the lunga point area . on august , the airfield was named henderson field after major lofton henderson , a marine aviator who had been killed at the battle of midway . the allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of henderson field were called the cactus air force after the allied code name for guadalcanal . in response to the allied landings on guadalcanal , the japanese imperial general headquarters assigned the imperial japanese army s th army a corps sized command based at rabaul s e and under the command of lieutenant general harukichi hyakutake with the task of retaking guadalcanal from allied forces . the th army heavily involved with the japanese campaign in new guinea had only a few units available to send to the southern solomons area . of these units , the th infantry brigade under major general kiyotake kawaguchi was at palau , the th aoba infantry regiment was in the philippines and the th ichiki infantry regiment under the command of colonel kiyonao ichiki was embarked on transport ships near guam . the different units began to move toward guadalcanal immediately ichiki s regiment the closest arrived first . the first element of ichiki s unit consisting of about soldiers landed from destroyers at taivu point s e , about mi km east of the lunga perimeter , on august . underestimating the strength of allied forces on guadalcanal , ichiki s first element conducted a nighttime frontal assault on marine positions at alligator creek on the east side of the lunga perimeter in the early morning hours of august . ichiki s assault was repulsed with devastating losses for the attackers in what became known as the battle of the tenaru all but of the men of the first element including ichiki himself were killed in the battle . the survivors returned to taivu point , notified th army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from rabaul . by august , kawaguchi s unit had reached truk and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to guadalcanal . because of the damage caused by allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the battle of the eastern solomons , the japanese decided not to deliver kawaguchi s troops to guadalcanal by slow transport ship instead , the ships carrying kawaguchi s soldiers were sent to rabaul . from there , the japanese planned to deliver kawaguchi s men to guadalcanal by destroyers , staging through a japanese naval base in the shortland islands . the japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down the slot to guadalcanal and back in a single night , minimizing their exposure to allied air attack . however , most of the soldiers heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to guadalcanal with them . these high speed destroyer runs to guadalcanal , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the tokyo express by allied forces and rat transportation by the japanese . the japanese controlled the seas around the solomon islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the allies . however , any japanese ship remaining within the mi km range of the aircraft at henderson field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks . this curious tactical situation held for several months . troop movement on august , of kawaguchi s troops were loaded onto the destroyers asagiri , amagiri , yugiri , and shirakumo , designated destroyer division dd . because of a shortage of fuel , dd could not make the entire round trip to guadalcanal at high speed in one night , but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower speed which conserved fuel . at that day , u.s. dive bombers from vmsb under the command of lt. col. richard mangrum , flew from henderson field and located and attacked dd about mi km north of guadalcanal , sinking asagiri and heavily damaging yugiri and shirakumo . amagiri took shirakumo in tow and the three destroyers returned to the shortlands without completing their mission . the attack on dd killed of kawaguchi s soldiers and crew members . subsequent express runs were more successful . between august and september , various japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost , troops at taivu point , including all of the th infantry brigade , one battalion of the aoba regiment , and the rest of ichiki s regiment . general kawaguchi , who landed at taivu point on the august express run , was placed in command of all the japanese troops on guadalcanal . on the night of september , as three of the express destroyers ydachi , hatsuyuki , and murakumo prepared to shell henderson field after landing their troops , they detected and sank two u.s. ships in the vicinity , the small , old destroyer transports called apds by the u.s. marines uss little and gregory that were used to shuttle allied troops around the guadalcanal tulagi area . in spite of the successes of the destroyer runs , kawaguchi insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to guadalcanal by slow barges . therefore , a convoy carrying , of kawaguchi s troops and heavy equipment in barges , mainly from the nd battalion , th infantry regiment under the command of colonel akinosuka oka , departed the northern coast of santa isabel island on september . on september , aircraft from henderson field attacked the barge convoy , killing about of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit s heavy equipment . most of the remaining , troops were able to land near kamimbo s e , west of the lunga perimeter over the next few days . by september , kawaguchi had , troops at taivu point and , west of the lunga perimeter . kawaguchi was confident enough that he could defeat the allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the th army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces . kawaguchi believed that there were only about , u.s. marines on guadalcanal . during this time , vandegrift continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the lunga perimeter . between august and september , he relocated three marine battalions including the st raider battalion , under u.s. lieutenant colonel merritt a. edson edson s raiders , and the st parachute battalion from tulagi and gavutu to guadalcanal . these units added about , troops to vandegrift s original , men defending henderson field . the st parachute battalion , which had suffered heavy casualties in the battle of tulagi and gavutu tanambogo in august , was placed under edson s command . battle prelude kawaguchi set the date for his attack on the lunga perimeter for september and began marching his forces west from taivu towards lunga point on september . he radioed th army and requested that it carry out air strikes on henderson field beginning on september , and that naval warships be stationed off lunga point on september to destroy any americans who attempted to flee from the island . on september , kawaguchi issued his attack plan to rout and annihilate the enemy in the vicinity of the guadalcanal island airfield . kawaguchi s plan called for his forces to split into three , approach the lunga perimeter inland , and launch a surprise night attack . oka s force would attack the perimeter from the west while ichiki s second echelon renamed the kuma battalion would attack from the east . the main attack would be by kawaguchi s center body , numbering , men in three battalions , from the south of the lunga perimeter . by september , most of kawaguchi s troops had started marching from taivu towards lunga point along the coastline . about japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade s supply base at taivu . meanwhile , native island scouts directed by british government official and officer in the british solomon islands protectorate defence force , martin clemens told the marines of japanese troops at taivu , near the village of tasimboko , about mi km east of lunga . edson launched a raid against the japanese troops at taivu . destroyer transports uss mckean and manley and two patrol boats took of edson s men to taivu in two trips . edson and his first wave of troops landed at taivu at local time on september . supported by aircraft from henderson field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , edson s men advanced towards tasimboko village but were slowed by japanese resistance . at , the rest of edson s men landed . with this reinforcement and more support from the henderson field aircraft , edson s force pushed into the village . the japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an allied supply ship convoy heading towards lunga point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind dead . two marines were killed . in tasimboko , edson s troops discovered the supply base for kawaguchi s forces , including large stockpiles of food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a shortwave radio . the marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the lunga perimeter at . the quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least , japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack . edson and colonel gerald thomas , vandegrift s operations officer , believed that the japanese attack would come at the lunga ridge , a narrow , grassy , , m , yd long , coral ridge s e parallel to the lunga river just south of henderson field . the ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended . edson and thomas tried to persuade vandegrift to move forces to defend the ridge , but vandegrift refused , believing that the japanese were more likely to attack along the coast . finally , thomas convinced vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for edson s raiders to rest from their actions of the preceding month . on september , the men of edson s unit including the st raiders and the paramarines deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it . kawaguchi s center body of troops was planning to attack the lunga perimeter at the ridge , which they called the centipede mukade gata because of its shape . on september , kawaguchi s troops left the coast at koli point . split into four columns , they marched into the jungle towards their predesignated attack points south and southeast of the airfield . lack of good maps , at least one faulty compass , and thick , almost impenetrable jungle caused the japanese columns to proceed slowly and zigzag , costing a lot of time . at the same time , oka s troops approached the lunga perimeter from the west . oka had some intelligence on the marine defenses , extracted from a u.s. army pilot captured on august . during the day of september , kawaguchi s troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night s attacks . kawaguchi wanted his three center body battalions in place by , but they did not reach their assembly areas until after . oka was also delayed in his advance towards the marine lines in the west . only the kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time . despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions , kawaguchi was still confident in his attack plan because a captured u.s. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the marine defenses . japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on september , causing a few casualties , including two killed . first night s action the americans knew of the approach of the japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or when they would attack . the ridge around which edson deployed his men consisted of three distinct hillocks . at the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was hill so named because it rose ft m above sea level . six hundred yards north was hill ft m high , the dominant feature on the ridge . the northernmost hillock was unnamed and about ft m high . edson placed the five companies from the raider battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from hill back to hill . two of the five raider companies , b and c , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy lagoon , and the lunga river . machine gun teams from e company , the heavy weapons company , were scattered throughout the defenses . edson placed his command post on hill . at on september , the japanese cruiser sendai and three destroyers shelled the lunga perimeter for minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight . japanese artillery began shelling the marine lines , but did little damage . at the same time , scattered groups of kawaguchi s troops began skirmishing with marines around the ridge . kawaguchi s st battalion led by major yukichi kokusho attacked the raider s c company between the lagoon and the lunga river , overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the marine company to fall back to the ridge . kokusho s unit became entangled with troops from kawaguchi s rd battalion under lieutenant colonel kusukichi watanabe , who were still struggling to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the japanese attack on the ridge that night . kawaguchi , who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the u.s. marine lines as well as coordinating his troops attacks , later complained , due to the devilish jungle , the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control . in my whole life i have never felt so disappointed and helpless . twelve u.s. marines were killed japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater . although both oka in the west and the kuma unit in the east tried to attack the marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the marine lines at dawn . at first light on september , cactus air force aircraft and marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge , forcing any japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle . the japanese suffered several casualties , including two officers from watanabe s battalion . at , kawaguchi decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night . second night s action on the ridge expecting the japanese to attack again that night , edson directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge . after a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground on the marine right flank lost to kokusho the night before , edson repositioned his forces . he pulled his front back about yd m to a line that stretched , yd , m , starting at the lunga river and crossing the ridge about yd m south of hill . around and behind hill he placed five companies . any japanese attackers surmounting hill would have to advance over yd m of open terrain to close with the marine positions at hill . with only a few hours to prepare , the marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications . they were low on ammunition , with one or two grenades for each marine . vandegrift ordered a reserve force consisting of the nd battalion , th marine regiment to move into a position just to the rear of edson s troops . in addition , a battery of four mm howitzers from the th marine regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge , and a forward artillery observer was placed with edson s front line units . late in the afternoon , edson stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops , saying , you men have done a great job , and i have just one more thing to ask of you . hold out just one more night . i know we ve been without sleep a long time . but we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here . i have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning . edson s speech raised the spirits of the raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead . as the sun set on september , kawaguchi faced edson s marines with , troops of his brigade , plus an assortment of light artillery . the night was pitch black , with no moon . at , seven japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge . kawaguchi s attack began just after nightfall , with kokusho s battalion assaulting raider company b on the marine right flank , just to the west of the ridge . the force of the assault caused company b to fall back to hill . under marine artillery fire , kokusho reassembled his men and continued his attack . without pausing to try to roll up the other nearby marine units , whose flanks were now unprotected , kokusho s unit surged forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the lunga river , heading for the airfield . kokusho s men came upon a pile of marine supplies and rations . not having eaten adequately for a couple of days , they paused to gorge themselves on the c and k rations . kokusho ordered his men to continue the attack . at about , he led them against the marine units around the northern portion of the ridge , just short of the airfield , as well as hill . in the heavy fighting that followed , kokusho and around of his men were killed , ending that attack . meanwhile , kawaguchi s nd battalion , under major masao tamura , assembled for their planned assault against hill from the jungle south of the ridge . marine observers spotted tamura s preparations and called in artillery fire . at about , a barrage from twelve mm . in guns hit tamura s position . in response , two companies of tamura s troops numbering about men charged up hill with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades . tamura s attack hit company b of the marine parachute battalion and also raider company b , pushing the parachutists off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the ridgeline . to protect the exposed raider company b , edson immediately ordered them to pull back onto hill . at the same time , a japanese company from watanabe s battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and parachute company c. deciding that their positions were now untenable , parachute companies b and c climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind hill . in the darkness and confusion of the battle , the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized . a few marines began yelling that the japanese were attacking with poison gas , scaring other marines who no longer possessed their gas masks . after arriving behind hill , some of the marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word withdraw to anyone within earshot . other marines began to follow them . just at the moment that it appeared that the marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a rout , edson , major kenneth d. bailey from edson s staff , and other marine officers appeared and , with vivid language , herded the marines back into defensive positions around hill . as the marines formed into a horseshoe shaped line around hill , tamura s battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill , charging up the saddle from hill and up from below the east side of the ridge . under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one japanese floatplane , the marines repulsed the first two attacks by tamura s men . tamura s troops hoisted a mm . in regimental gun to the top of hill in an effort to fire it directly at the marines . this gun , which could have turned the tide in favor of the japanese , however , was disabled by a faulty firing pin . at midnight , during a short lull in the fighting , edson ordered parachute companies b and c to advance from behind hill to strengthen his left flank . with fixed bayonets , the paramarines swept forward , killing japanese soldiers who had overrun the marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the marine lines from the flank , and took position on the east side of the hill . marines from other units , as well as members of edson s command staff , including major bailey , took ammunition and grenades under fire to the marines around hill , who were running critically low . said marine participant captain william j. mckennan , the japanese attack was almost constant , like a rain that subsides for a moment and then pours the harder ... when one wave was mowed down and i mean mowed down another followed it into death . the japanese hit edson s left flank just after the parachutists took position but were again stopped by marine rifle , machine gun , mortar , and grenade fire . marine mm and mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking japanese . a captured japanese soldier later said that his unit was annihilated by the marine artillery fire , which only of his company survived . by , after withstanding several more assaults , some of which resulted in hand to hand fighting , and severe sniper fire from all sides , edson s men were joined by troops from the nd battalion , th marine regiment , who helped repulse two more japanese attacks before dawn . throughout the night , as kawaguchi s men came close to overrunning the marine defenses , edson remained standing about yd m behind the marine firing line on hill , exhorting his troops and directing their defensive efforts . said marine captain tex smith , who was in position to observe edson for most of the night , i can say that if there is such a thing as one man holding a battalion together , edson did it that night . he stood just behind the front lines stood , when most of us hugged the ground . during the heavy fighting , portions of three japanese companies , including two from tamura s and one from watanabe s battalions , skirted the marine defenses on the ridge , while suffering heavy losses from marine gunfire , and reached the edge of fighter one , a secondary runway of henderson field . a counterattack by the marine engineers stopped one japanese company s advances and forced it to retreat . the other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield . when no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after daybreak . most of the rest of watanabe s battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night . as the sun rose on september , pockets of japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge . but with tamura s battalion shattered after losing of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , kawaguchi s assault on the ridge had effectively ended . about japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of hill , perhaps preparing for one more charge on hill . at first light , three u.s. army aircraft from the th fighter squadron at henderson field , acting on a request personally delivered by bailey , strafed the japanese near hill and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle . kuma and oka attacks as the battle on the ridge took place , kawaguchi s kuma and oka units also attacked the marine defenses on the east and west sides of the lunga perimeter . the kuma battalion led by major takeshi mizuno attacked the southeastern sector of the lunga perimeter , defended by marines of the rd battalion , st marine regiment . mizuno s attack started around midnight , with one company attacking through marine artillery fire and engaging in hand to hand combat with the marine defenders before being thrown back . mizuno was killed in the attack . after daybreak , the marines , believing that the rest of mizuno s battalion was still in the area , sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the marine lines four japanese mm . in anti tank guns destroyed or disabled three of them . after abandoning their burning tanks , several of the disabled tanks crewmembers were bayoneted and killed by the japanese . one tank tumbled down an embankment into the tenaru river , drowning its crew . at on september , the remnants of the kuma battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the marine lines , but were repulsed . a final weak attack by the kuma unit on the evening of september was also defeated . oka s unit of about men attacked the marines at several locations on the west side of the lunga perimeter . at about on september , two japanese companies attacked positions held by the rd battalion , th marine regiment near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses . another japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of september . the rest of oka s unit failed to find the marine lines and did not participate in the attack . aftermath at on september , kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle , where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day . kawaguchi s units were then ordered to withdraw west to the matanikau river valley to join with oka s unit , a mi . km march over difficult terrain . kawaguchi s troops began the march on the morning of september . almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded . as the march progressed , the exhausted and hungry soldiers , who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal , began to discard their heavy equipment and then their rifles . by the time most of them reached oka s positions at kokumbona five days later , only half still carried their weapons . the kuma battalion s survivors , attempting to follow kawaguchi s center body forces , became lost , wandered for three weeks in the jungle , and almost starved to death before finally reaching kawaguchi s camp . in total , kawaguchi s forces lost about killed in the attack , including in tamura s battalion , in kokusho s battalion , in oka s force , in the kuma battalion , and in watanabe s battalion . an unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the matanikau . on and around the ridge , the marines counted japanese dead , including on the slopes of hill . the marines suffered killed between and september . on september , vandegrift sent two companies from the st battalion , st marine regiment to pursue the retreating japanese . the marines were ambushed by two japanese companies acting as rear guards for the withdrawal , and one marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the marines retreated . the marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by vandegrift . by nightfall , the japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon , killing marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving . on september , a patrol from edson s raiders encountered stragglers from kawaguchi s retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed of them . as the japanese regrouped west of the matanikau , the u.s. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their lunga defenses . on september , vandegrift moved another battalion , the rd battalion , nd marine regiment , from tulagi to guadalcanal . on september , an allied naval convoy delivered , men from the rd provisional marine brigade the u.s. th marine regiment augmented by additional support units to guadalcanal . these reinforcements allowed vandegrift beginning on september to establish an unbroken line of defense around the lunga perimeter . vandegrift s forces next significant clashes with the japanese occurred along the matanikau river from september and october . significance on september , general hyakutake at rabaul learned of kawaguchi s defeat , the imperial japanese army s first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war . the general forwarded the news to the imperial general headquarters in japan . in an emergency session , the top japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that , guadalcanal might develop into the decisive battle of the war . the results of the battle began to have a telling strategic impact on japanese operations in other areas of the pacific . hyakutake realized that , in order to send sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the allied forces on guadalcanal , he could no longer support the major japanese offensive on the kokoda track in new guinea . hyakutake with the concurrence of the general headquarters ordered his troops on new guinea , who were within mi km of their objective of port moresby to withdraw until the guadalcanal matter was resolved . the japanese were never able to restart their drive towards port moresby the defeat at edson s ridge contributed not only to japan s defeat in the guadalcanal campaign , but also to japan s ultimate defeat throughout the south pacific . after delivering more forces during the next month the japanese mounted a major ground offensive on guadalcanal , led by hyakutake , in late october at the battle for henderson field , but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the japanese . vandegrift later stated that kawaguchi s assault on the ridge in september was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded , we would have been in a pretty bad condition . historian richard b. frank adds , the japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in september , on a ridge thrusting up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield , best known ever after as bloody ridge . new jersey route route is a state highway in the southern part of the u.s. state of new jersey . it runs . mi . km from an intersection with u.s. route us and the garden state parkway in upper township , cape may county to an intersection with us and county route cr in egg harbor city , atlantic county . the route , which is mostly a two lane undivided road , passes through mostly rural areas of atlantic and cape may counties as well as the communities of tuckahoe , corbin city , estell manor , and mays landing . nj intersects several roads , including route in tuckahoe , us in mays landing , and us and the atlantic city expressway in hamilton township . the portion of current route between seaville and petersburg received funding in to become a spur of the ocean highway . in , what is now route was designated a part of pre route , a route that was to run from cape may to egg harbor city . route was designated onto its current alignment in , replacing this portion of pre route . in , a freeway was proposed for route , running from the garden state parkway in dennis township to us in mullica township . this proposal was canceled by the mid s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic . the interchange between route and the atlantic city expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange , with completion in june . route description route begins at an intersection with us in the seaville section of upper township , cape may county , heading to the north on a two lane undivided road . from the southern terminus , a ramp provides access to and from the southbound garden state parkway . the road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings . it intersects cr in greenfield before coming to a junction with cr . later , route cedar swamp creek in an area of marshland . at this crossing , the road runs closely parallel to a conrail shared assets operations railroad line before entering petersburg , where it splits from the railroad tracks and comes to a crossroad with cr . upon leaving petersburg , route turns to the north again and crosses over the conrail shared assets operations railroad line , intersecting cr . it continues to tuckahoe and comes to cr . past this intersection , the route meets cr and cr . route forms a concurrency with cr and the two routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus of route before leaving tuckahoe . not far after route , the road crosses the tuckahoe river into corbin city , atlantic county . in corbin city , it heads into residential areas , with cr looping to the west of the route . route and cr continue northwest and intersect cr , where the road turns north into more forested areas . at the junction with cr , the route turns to the northeast and enters estell manor , becoming broad street . cr splits from route by heading northwest on buena tuckahoe road and route heads through some agricultural clearings concurrent with cr truck , passing to the west of the macnamara wildlife area , which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds . the route intersects cr , turning to the northeast . after passing some homes and stephen lake , the road turns to the north and passes to the west of estell manor county park . the route crosses the south river into weymouth township , passing the residential community of belcoville to the east and meeting cr . it soon enters hamilton township , where the name of the road becomes mill street and it comes to a junction with us harding highway . cr truck heads to the west on us at this point while route heads east on us , and cr continues north . us and nj follow the harding highway , a two lane undivided road , turning to the northeast and crossing the great egg harbor river . upon passing over the river , enters mays landing and turns north , encountering cr before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of mays landing . here , the road crosses cr , and us splits from nj by turning east along that road . meanwhile , route continues north on cape may avenue , passing through developed areas . it leaves mays landing and heads into back into forests . the route turns to the northeast , passing near the clover leaf lakes residential development , before coming to an interchange with us black horse pike . past this interchange , route widens to a four lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the atlantic city expressway . the route becomes a two lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas , crossing into galloway township , where there is an intersection with cr . a short distance later , the road crosses new jersey transit s atlantic city line near the egg harbor city station and enters egg harbor city , turning into philadelphia avenue . a block after the railroad crossing , route ends at an intersection with us and cr white horse pike , with cr continuing north on philadelphia avenue at this point . route is an important route linking the atlantic city expressway with the jersey shore resorts in cape may county , serving as an alternate to more congested routes . it also serves as evacuation route from cape may county to inland areas in the event of a hurricane . history the portion of current route between seaville and petersburg received funding to become a spur of the ocean highway in . the modern day alignment of route was legislated as part of pre route in , a route that was to run from cape may to egg harbor city . in the new jersey state highway renumbering , the portion of pre route between seaville and egg harbor city was designated as route , the highest state route number assigned in the renumbering . route retained its current routing in the new jersey state highway renumbering . a freeway was proposed for route around , running from the garden state parkway in dennis township north to us in mullica township . this proposed freeway was intended to provide economic development to the region as well as provide a better route to the jersey shore resorts of cape may county for travelers from the delaware valley . however , this freeway was canceled by the mid s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic along route . on november , , construction began on making the interchange with the atlantic city expressway a full interchange as part of a series of improvements set for the atlantic city expressway . this project was completed on june , . major intersections air rhodesia flight air rhodesia flight was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the zimbabwe people s revolutionary army zipra on september , during the rhodesian bush war . the aircraft involved , a vickers viscount named the hunyani , was flying the last leg of air rhodesia s regular scheduled service from victoria falls to the capital salisbury , via the resort town of kariba . soon after flight took off , a group of zipra guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a soviet made strela surface to air infrared homing missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing . an attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of karoi was foiled by an unseen ditch , which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up . of the passengers and four crew , died in this crash the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire . three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush , while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived . zipra leader joshua nkomo publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the hunyani in an interview with the bbc s today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground . the majority of rhodesians , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of terrorism . a fierce white rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general , even though few black rhodesians supported attacks of this kind . reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as time magazine , but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments , much to the rhodesian government s indignation . talks between nkomo and prime minister ian smith , which had been progressing promisingly , were immediately suspended by the furious rhodesians , with smith calling nkomo a monster . on september , smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas . the rhodesian security forces launched several retaliatory strikes into zambia and mozambique over the following months , attacking both zipra and its rival , the zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla . the attack on zipra in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions . five months later , in february , zipra shot down air rhodesia flight , another civilian flight , in an almost identical incident . background a dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self governing colony of rhodesia or southern rhodesia led the colonial government , headed by prime minister ian smith , to unilaterally declare independence from the united kingdom on november . the idea of no independence before majority rule had recently gained ground in britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and rhodesia s government was dominated by the country s white minority , so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally . britain and the united nations imposed economic sanctions on rhodesia . two rival communist backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule the chinese aligned zimbabwe african national union zanu , mostly comprising shonas , created the zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla and adopted aspects of maoist doctrine , while the ndebele dominated zimbabwe african people s union zapu , aligned with soviet style marxism leninism and the warsaw pact , mobilised the zimbabwe people s revolutionary army zipra . these guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the second chimurenga against the rhodesian government and security forces . the resulting conflict , the rhodesian bush war , began in earnest in december , when zanla attacked altena and whistlefield farms in north eastern rhodesia . after the security forces mounted a successful counter insurgency campaign during and , developments overseas caused the conflict s momentum to shift in the insurgents favour . the leftist carnation revolution of april caused portugal to withdraw its key economic support for smith s administration , and led to mozambique s independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with zanu . around the same time , rhodesia s other main backer , south africa , adopted a dtente initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup . following the abortive victoria falls conference of august , smith and the zapu leader joshua nkomo held unsuccessful talks between december and march . zanu and zapu announced in october , during the run up to the unsuccessful geneva conference in december , that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint patriotic front . in march , smith and non militant nationalist groups headed by bishop abel muzorewa , the reverend ndabaningi sithole and chief jeremiah chirau agreed what became the internal settlement . this created a joint black white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as zimbabwe rhodesia in june , pursuant to multiracial elections . zanu and zapu were invited to participate , but refused nkomo sardonically dubbed smith s black colleagues the blacksmiths . zanu proclaimed to be the year of the people as the war continued . officials from muzorewa s united african national council , sent to the provinces to explain the internal settlement to rural blacks , were killed by marxist leninist guerrillas . insurgents also began to target christian missionaries , climaxing in the killing of nine british missionaries and four children at elim mission near the mozambican border on june . the transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the internal settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judiciary and the civil service under white control . no country recognised rhodesia s interim administration . smith again worked to bring nkomo into the government , hoping this would lend it some credence domestically , prompt diplomatic recognition overseas , and help the security forces defeat zanla . starting on august , he attended secret meetings with nkomo in lusaka , zambia where zapu was based , doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation lonrho . attempts were made to also involve the zanu leader robert mugabe , but mugabe would have no part in the talks . according to the south african military historian jakkie cilliers , negotiations between smith and nkomo progressed well and seemed on the verge of success by the start of september . on september , smith and nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place . incident prior threats to rhodesian air traffic rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about , in the latter stages of the war before this time , neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target . the weapon that made such attacks feasible for zipra was the strela shoulder launched surface to air missile launcher , supplied by the soviet union from the mid s as part of the warsaw pact s materiel support . by september , there had been reported attempts to shoot down rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons , none of which had been successful . some rhodesian air force dakotas had been hit , but all had survived and landed safely . no civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the bush war . flight air rhodesia was the country s national airline , established by the government on september to succeed central african airways , which was dissolved at the end of that year . based at salisbury airport , air rhodesia s flight network during the late s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights , as well as international services to the south african cities of johannesburg and durban . the flight aircraft was a vickers viscount d , a british made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing . it was named the hunyani after the river of the same name , which flowed between lake kariba and the rhodesian capital salisbury . the hunyani was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between victoria falls and salisbury , stopping over in the resort town of kariba . despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on kariba by zipra guerrillas on the northern side of the zambezi in zambia , the resort had endured as one of rhodesia s choice tourist destinations . the flight on september , sunday afternoon , from kariba to salisbury carried four crew members and passengers , most of whom were holidaymakers from salisbury , returning home after a weekend at the lake . the flight took off from kariba airport on schedule soon after central africa time . flight was piloted by year old captain john hood , a native of bulawayo who had gained his commercial pilot licence in . he had flown viscounts for air rhodesia since , and had also served in the rhodesian air force on a voluntary basis . his first officer , garth beaumont , was years old , and had lived in rhodesia for most of his life , having immigrated as a child from south africa . the two air stewardesses were dulcie esterhuizen , years old and from bulawayo , and year old louise pearson , from salisbury . shootdown a group of zipra guerrillas , armed with a strela launcher , waited in the bush beneath flight s flightpath , and fired on the hunyani about five minutes after it took off , while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight . the heat seeking missile hit the plane s starboard wing and exploded , causing the inner engine to also explode . a fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured , creating a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out . the second starboard engine failed almost immediately , leaving hood with only his two port engines . heaving wildly , the hunyani began to descend rapidly . at captain hood sent a distress call to air traffic control , informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash . we re going in , he radioed . telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing , he aimed for an open field of cotton in the whamira hills , in the bush to the west of karoi , intending to belly land the craft . the landing was relatively stable until the hunyani hit a previously unseen ditch , cartwheeled and exploded . the remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire , setting the wrecked cabin ablaze . massacre on the ground of the people on board , , including hood and beaumont , died in the crash . eighteen survived , albeit with injuries , and climbed out of the wreckage . after briefly settling the others , one of the passengers , dr cecil maclaren , led four others young newlyweds robert and shannon hargreaves , mrs sharon coles , and her four year old daughter tracey off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water . the other remained close to the wreckage . meanwhile , nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site , and reached it at about . three of the survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching rhodesian army reservist anthony hill , , took cover in the surrounding bush , while businessman hans hansen and his wife diana did the same . this left passengers in full view near the wreckage , including four women and two girls aged and . the guerrillas , who were armed with ak rifles , presented themselves to the passengers as friendly , saying they would summon help and bring water . they spoke in english , both to the survivors and among themselves . they told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk , the insurgents told the able bodied men to carry the others . the passengers were assembled into an area of about square metres sq ft . standing roughly metres ft away , the cadres now raised their weapons . you have taken our land , one of them said . please don t shoot us one of the passengers cried , just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire . having collected water from the nearby village , maclaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots . thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat , they continued on their way , and called out to the other passengers , who they thought were still alive . this alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors one of the guerrillas told maclaren s group to come here . the insurgents then opened fire on their general location , prompting maclaren and the others to flee . hill and the hansens also ran they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste , but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge . after hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours , they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about . the guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site , filled their arms with various passengers belongings , then left again . the survivors were found over the following days by the rhodesian army and police hill and mr and mrs hansen were taken to kariba hospital , while maclaren and his group were airlifted to andrew fleming hospital in salisbury . nkomo claims responsibility , but denies killing survivors nkomo claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the bbc s today radio programme the next day , laughing as he did so , to the horror of most rhodesian observers , both black and white . he said that he had received intelligence that the hunyani was being used for military purposes . nkomo said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party s policy to kill civilians , and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground by contrast , he said that his men had helped them , and had left them alive . he also accused air rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war materiel for the government , an allegation that captain pat travers , air rhodesia s general manager , called a downright , deliberate lie . according to eliakim sibanda , a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of zapu , nkomo was implying that responsibility for the massacre actually lay with security force pseudo guerrillas , more specifically the mixed race selous scouts unit , which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion . sibanda asserts that the massacre cannot be put beyond the scouts , and also supports nkomo s claim that the hunyani had been used militarily , suggesting that zipra might have believed there to be rhodesian soldiers on board . rhodesian television , before attacks on zanla in mozambique , had shown viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job , he writes , ... and zipra intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed at victoria falls . reactions white rhodesians turn against blacks a report published in the american magazine time a fortnight later described the incident as a genuine horror story , calculated to make the most alarming of rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true . indeed , the white community in rhodesia heard the news with fury , and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism . the prominent indian rhodesian gulab family was particularly affected by the incident , having lost eight members in the attack . though rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash , doing so only after four days investigation , the truth was common knowledge in salisbury within hours . smith wrote in his memoirs that the degree of anger ... was difficult to control . white south africans were similarly enraged , particularly after reports appeared in the south african press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring them . a friends of rhodesia society in south africa offered a reward of r, to anybody who would either kill nkomo or bring him to salisbury to stand trial . geoffrey nyarota , who was then one of the few black reporters at the rhodesia herald newspaper , later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general , believing them all to be terrorist sympathisers . describing the herald newsroom the night of the incident , he relates a vile collective temper among the white sub editors they cursed until their voices became hoarse , threatening dire consequences for all terrs and munts or kaffirs ... i sensed that some of the more derogatory remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears . several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days . according to the time article , a group of whites entered an unsegregated salisbury bar fingering the triggers of rifles and forced blacks drinking there to leave . time also reported a rumour that two white youths , on learning of the massacre , shot the first black man they saw . smith says that several would be vigilante groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to make the local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting the terrorists . he instructed them not to , according to his memoirs , telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress , and that it would not do to attack them . many rhodesians also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments , especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target . memorial service , september at a memorial service held on september for flight s passengers and crew at salisbury s anglican cathedral , about , people crowded inside , with another standing outside on the steps and pavement , many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets . prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed air rhodesia and south african airways personnel , as well as rhodesian special air service soldiers and senior officers from other military units . smith and several government ministers also attended , including p k van der byl , the co minister of foreign affairs . dean john de costa gave a sermon damning what he described as a deafening silence from overseas . nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the viscount , he said . but are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised we are not like men in the story of the good samaritan , they pass by on the other side ... the ghastliness of this ill fated flight from kariba will be burnt upon our memories for years to come . for others , far from our borders , it is an intellectual matter , not one which affects them deeply . here is the tragedy smith nkomo talks halted the talks between smith and the zapu leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by salisbury . smith himself called nkomo a monster . cilliers comments that the ending of the smith nkomo talks at this time was potentially the most serious result of the viscount massacre , as the talks had been progressing well before the incident . he surmises that an agreement between the two at this critical stage might have helped the transitional rhodesian government to secure international recognition . on september , the prime minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law , which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed . he declared rhodesia s intent to liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism , and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for any defensive strikes we might undertake against guerrilla bases in their respective territories . he claimed that the war had escalated because britain and the united states were supporting the patriotic front . william irvine , the co minister of transport , warned the guerrillas that rhodesia w ould not let these innocents go unavenged . rhodesia strikes back operation snoopy rhodesia hits new chimoio because zapu and zipra were based in zambia , many rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country , but the first external target hit by the security forces following the viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of zanla bases around chimoio in mozambique . the rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in november during operation dingo , destroying much of the zanla presence there , but the insurgents had since built a complex called new chimoio , slightly to the east the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals . in a combined airborne ground assault called operation snoopy , the rhodesian air force , rhodesian light infantry and special air service wiped out much of new chimoio on september . mozambique sent armour to zanla s aid in the form of nine soviet made t tanks and four russian btr armoured personnel carriers , but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the rhodesian security forces . according to rhodesian figures , there were several hundred guerrillas killed , while the security forces lost only two soldiers , one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike . operation gatling the green leader raid rhodesia then attacked zipra s bases in zambia , in what group captain peter petter bowyer later described as payback time for flight . operation gatling , launched on october , was another joint force operation between the air force and the army , which contributed special air service and rhodesian light infantry paratroopers . gatling s primary target , just kilometres miles north east of central lusaka , was the formerly white owned westlands farm , which had been transformed into zipra s main headquarters and training base under the name freedom camp . zipra presumed that rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to lusaka . about , guerrillas underwent training at freedom camp , with senior zipra staff also on site . the rhodesian operation s other targets were chikumbi , kilometres miles north of lusaka , and mkushi camp all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across zambia . assaulting targets deep inside zambia was a first for the rhodesian forces previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked . led by squadron leader chris dixon , who identified himself to lusaka airport tower as green leader , a rhodesian air force group flew into zambia at very low altitudes thereby avoiding zambian radar and took control of the country s airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on westlands farm , informing lusaka tower that the attack was against rhodesian dissidents , and not against zambia , and that rhodesian hawker hunters were circling the zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off . the zambians obeyed all of green leader s instructions , made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic . using rufunsa airstrip in eastern zambia as a forward base , the rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three day operation , and afterwards claimed to have killed over , zipra personnel , as well as some cuban instructors . historians paul moorcraft and peter mclaughlin write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed , as most of nkomo s army , then numbering about , fighters , had not been touched . on the other hand , unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions , and hundreds of these had been killed in the rhodesian raid . moorcraft and mclaughlin comment that for the rhodesian airmen , it would have been impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young zipra recruits . sibanda describes freedom camp as a refugee camp for boys , and says boys and girls were killed . he claims that the red cross and the un refugee agency confirmed zapu s claim that smith s forces struck at defenseless , civilian trainees . aftermath the rhodesian attacks on zanla and zipra bases did much to restore white morale following the viscount incident , though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns . nkomo and the zambian president kenneth kaunda all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the soviets and the british respectively . martial law was quickly extended across rhodesia s rural areas , and covered three quarters of the country by the end of . air rhodesia , meanwhile , began developing anti strela shielding for its viscounts . before this work was completed , zipra shot down a second viscount , air rhodesia flight , on february . this time there were no survivors . following the second shootdown , air rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the viscounts would be coated with low radiation paint , with the exhaust pipes concurrently shrouded . according to tests conducted by the air force , a viscount so treated could not be detected by the strela s targeting system once it was over , feet m . there were no further viscount shootdowns in rhodesia . in the elections held the following year under the internal settlement terms , boycotted by zanu and zapu , muzorewa won a majority , and became the first prime minister of the reconstituted , majority ruled state of zimbabwe rhodesia on june . this new order failed to win international acceptance , however , and in december the lancaster house agreement was agreed in london by zimbabwe rhodesia , the uk government and the patriotic front , returning the country to its former colonial status . the uk government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period . fresh elections were won by mugabe , who took power in april , concurrently with the country s recognised independence as zimbabwe . legacy and memorial in modern zimbabwe , it is not the viscount shootdowns but rather the retributory rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory . state media in zimbabwe , prominently the herald newspaper , often claim that rhodesian forces indiscriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during such operations . zipra s downing of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board . the massacre of surviving flight passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than zipra in his memoirs nkomo repeated his claim that zipra fighters had helped the survivors , and wrote simply that i truly have no idea how the ten died . a monument to those killed in the rhodesian attack on chikumbi was built in zambia in , and dedicated jointly by the zambian and zimbabwean governments . a memorial to the victims of the two rhodesian viscount incidents , dubbed the viscount memorial , was erected on the grounds of the voortrekker monument in pretoria , south africa in , and inaugurated on september that year . the names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright , side by side , the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft . a pole beside the monument flies the rhodesian flag . a british parliamentary motion put forward by labour mp kate hoey in february to retrospectively condemn the viscount attacks and memorialise the victims on the anniversary of the second shootdown prompted outcry in the zimbabwean press , with the herald branding it a racist rhodie motion intended to antagonise the mugabe administration and its supporters . dumiso dabengwa , a former zipra commander , described the move as a provocation motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at lancaster house . christopher mutsvangwa , a diplomat and political analyst , took a similar line , calling hoey s proposed commemoration a provocation ... that means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle . there is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country . zapu s official response to hoey s motion included the assertion that in all conflicts civilians get caught up in cross fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors , and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the viscount shootdowns with those killed at chikumbi . newspaper and journal articles tikal tikal tikl tik al in modern mayan orthography is the ruins of an ancient city found in a rainforest in guatemala . ambrosio tut , a gum sapper , reported the ruins to la gaceta , a guatemalan newspaper , which named the site tikal . after the berlin academy of sciences magazine republished the report in , archeologists and treasure hunters began visiting the forest . today tourism to the site may help protect the rainforest . it is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre columbian maya civilization . it is located in the archaeological region of the petn basin in what is now northern guatemala . situated in the department of el petn , the site is part of guatemala s tikal national park and in it was declared a unesco world heritage site . tikal was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient maya . though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the th century bc , tikal reached its apogee during the classic period , c . to ad . during this time , the city dominated much of the maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of teotihuacan in the distant valley of mexico . there is evidence that tikal was conquered by teotihuacan in the th century ad . following the end of the late classic period , no new major monuments were built at tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . these events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site s abandonment by the end of the th century . tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments , temples and palaces . etymology the name tikal may be derived from ti ak al in the yucatec maya language it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning at the waterhole . the name was apparently applied to one of the site s ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region . it has alternatively been interpreted as meaning the place of the voices in the itza maya language . tikal , however , is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the s . hieroglyphic inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as yax mutal or yax mutul , meaning first mutal . tikal may have come to have been called this because dos pilas also came to use the same emblem glyph the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name . the kingdom as a whole was simply called mutul , which is the reading of the hair bundle emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo . its precise meaning remains obscure . location the closest large modern settlements are flores and santa elena , approximately kilometres mi by road to the southwest . tikal is approximately kilometres mi north of guatemala city . it is kilometres mi south of the contemporary maya city of uaxactun and kilometres mi northwest of yaxha . the city was located kilometres mi southeast of its great classic period rival , calakmul , and kilometres mi northwest of calakmul s ally caracol , now in belize . the city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than square kilometres . sq mi that included about , structures . the topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands . the major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised causeways spanning the swamps . the area around tikal has been declared as the tikal national park and the preserved area covers square kilometres sq mi . the ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern guatemala that formed the cradle of lowland maya civilization . the city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils , and may have dominated a natural east west trade route across the yucatan peninsula . conspicuous trees at the tikal park include gigantic kapok ceiba pentandra the sacred tree of the maya tropical cedar cedrela odorata , and honduras mahogany swietenia macrophylla . regarding the fauna , agouti , white nosed coatis , gray foxes , geoffroy s spider monkeys , howler monkeys , harpy eagles , falcons , ocellated turkeys , guans , toucans , green parrots and leafcutter ants can be seen there regularly . jaguars , jaguarundis , and cougars are also said to roam in the park . for centuries this city was completely covered under jungle . the average annual rainfall at tikal is , millimetres . in . one of the largest of the classic maya cities , tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored in ten reservoirs . archaeologists working in tikal during the th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use . the tikal national park covers an area of . square kilometres . sq mi . it was created on may under the auspices of the instituto de antropologa e historia and was the first protected area in guatemala . population population estimates for tikal vary from , to as high as , inhabitants , with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range . the population of tikal began a continuous curve of growth starting in the preclassic period approximately bc ad , with a peak in the late classic with the population growing rapidly from ad through to , followed by a sharp decline . for the square kilometres sq mi area falling within the earthwork defenses of the hinterland , the peak population is estimated at per square kilometer per square mile . in an area within a kilometres . mi radius of the site core , peak population is estimated at , population density is estimated at per square kilometer per square mile . in a region within a kilometres mi radius of the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated at , with a density of per square kilometer per square mile . these population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive swamplands that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture . however , some archaeologists , such as david webster , believe these figures to be far too high . rulers the dynastic line of tikal , founded as early as the st century ad , spanned years and included at least rulers . history preclassic there are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as bc , in the middle preclassic . a cache of mamon ceramics dating from about bc were found in a sealed chultun , a subterranean bottle shaped chamber . major construction at tikal was already taking place in the late preclassic period , first appearing around bc , including the building of major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as el mirador and nakbe . at this time , tikal participated in the widespread chikanel culture that dominated the central and northern maya areas at this time a region that included the entire yucatan peninsula including northern and eastern guatemala and all of belize . two temples dating to late chikanel times had masonry walled superstructures that may have been corbel vaulted , although this has not been proven . one of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a scrollwork background , painted in yellow , black , pink and red . in the st century ad rich burials first appeared and tikal underwent a political and cultural florescence as its giant northern neighbors declined . at the end of the late preclassic , the izapan style art and architecture from the pacific coast began to influence tikal , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the acropolis and early murals at the city . early classic dynastic rulership among the lowland maya is most deeply rooted at tikal . according to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by yax moch xoc , perhaps in the rd century ad . at the beginning of the early classic , power in the maya region was concentrated at tikal and calakmul , in the core of the maya heartland . tikal may have benefited from the collapse of the large preclassic states such as el mirador . in the early classic tikal rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the maya region , stimulating the development of other nearby maya cities . the site , however , was often at war and inscriptions tell of alliances and conflict with other maya states , including uaxactun , caracol , naranjo and calakmul . the site was defeated at the end of the early classic by caracol , which rose to take tikal s place as the paramount center in the southern maya lowlands . the earlier part of the early classic saw hostilities between tikal and its neighbor uaxactun , with uaxactun recording the capture of prisoners from tikal . there appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by ad , when lady unen bahlam conducted a katun ending ceremony , apparently as queen of the city . tikal and teotihuacan the fourteenth king of tikal was chak tok ich aak great jaguar paw . chak tok ich aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the central acropolis . little is known about chak tok ich aak except that he was killed on january ad . on the same day , siyah k ak fire is born arrived from the west , having passed through el peru , a site to the west of tikal , on january . on stela he is named as lord of the west . siyah k ak was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non maya hieroglyph of a spearthrower combined with an owl , a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of teotihuacan in the distant valley of mexico . spearthrower owl may even have been the ruler of teotihuacan . these recorded events strongly suggest that siyah k ak led a teotihuacan invasion that defeated the native tikal king , who was captured and immediately executed . siyah k ak appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at tikal itself roughly at the time of the conquest , a group of teotihuacan natives were apparently residing near the lost world complex . he also exerted control over other cities in the area , including uaxactun , where he became king , but did not take the throne of tikal for himself . within a year , the son of spearthrower owl by the name of yax nuun ayiin i first crocodile had been installed as the tenth king of tikal while he was still a boy , being enthroned on september . he reigned for years as king of tikal , and remained a vassal of siyah k ak for as long as the latter lived . it seems likely that yax nuun ayiin i took a wife from the preexisting , defeated , tikal dynasty and thus legitimized the right to rule of his son , siyaj chan k awiil ii . ro azul , a small site kilometres mi northeast of tikal , was conquered by the latter during the reign of yax nuun ayiin i. the site became an outpost of tikal , shielding it from hostile cities further north , and also became a trade link to the caribbean . although the new rulers of tikal were foreign , their descendants were rapidly mayanized . tikal became the key ally and trading partner of teotihuacan in the maya lowlands . after being conquered by teotihuacan , tikal rapidly dominated the northern and eastern peten . uaxactun , together with smaller towns in the region , were absorbed into tikal s kingdom . other sites , such as bejucal and motul de san jos near lake petn itz became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north . by the middle of the th century tikal had a core territory of at least kilometres mi in every direction . around the th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of tikal s hinterland , joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of swampland lying to the east and west of the city . additional fortifications were probably also built to the south . these defenses protected tikal s core population and agricultural resources , encircling an area of approximately square kilometres sq mi . recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose . tikal and copn in the th century the power of the city reached as far south as copn , whose founder k inich yax k uk mo was clearly connected with tikal . copn itself was not in an ethnically maya region and the founding of the copn dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of tikal . k inich yax k uk mo arrived in copn in december and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at tikal . an individual known as ajaw k uk mo lord k uk mo is referred to in an early text at tikal and may well be the same person . his tomb had teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of teotihuacan . hieroglyphic texts refer to him as lord of the west , much like siyah k ak . at the same time , in late , copn founded the nearby site of quirigu , possibly sponsored by tikal itself . the founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose tikal s authority upon the southeastern portion of the maya region . the interaction between these sites and tikal was intense over the next three centuries . a long running rivalry between tikal and calakmul began in the th century , with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile alliances arrayed against each other in what has been likened to a long running war between two maya superpowers . the kings of these two capitals adopted the title kaloomte , a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to high king . the early th century saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the lady of tikal , who was very likely a daughter of chak tok ich aak ii . she seems never to have ruled in her own right , rather being partnered with male co rulers . the first of these was kaloomte b alam , who seems to have had a long career as a general at tikal before becoming co ruler and th in the dynastic sequence . the lady of tikal herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering . it appears she was later paired with lord bird claw , who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown th ruler . . late classic tikal hiatus in the mid th century , caracol seems to have allied with calakmul and defeated tikal , closing the early classic . the tikal hiatus refers to a period between the late th to late th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large scale construction at tikal . in the latter half of the th century ad , a serious crisis befell the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture . this hiatus in activity at tikal was long unexplained until later epigraphic decipherments identified that the period was prompted by tikal s comprehensive defeat at the hands of calakmul and the caracol polity in ad , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of tikal . the badly eroded altar at caracol described how tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in april . it seems that caracol was an ally of calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and tikal , with the defeat of tikal having a lasting impact upon the city . tikal was not sacked but its power and influence were broken . after its great victory , caracol grew rapidly and some of tikal s population may have been forcibly relocated there . during the hiatus period , at least one ruler of tikal took refuge with janaab pakal of palenque , another of calakmul s victims . calakmul itself thrived during tikal s long hiatus period . the beginning of the tikal hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly subdivide the classic period of mesoamerican chronology into the early and late classic . tikal and dos pilas in tikal founded dos pilas , some kilometres mi to the southwest , as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the pasin river . b alaj chan k awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four , in , and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother , the king of tikal . roughly twenty years later dos pilas was attacked by calakmul and was soundly defeated . b alaj chan k awiil was captured by the king of calakmul but , instead of being sacrificed , he was re instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy , and attacked tikal in , forcing nuun ujol chaak , the then king of tikal , to temporarily abandon the city . the first two rulers of dos pilas continued to use the mutal emblem glyph of tikal , and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of tikal itself . for some reason , b alaj chan k awiil was not installed as the new ruler of tikal instead he stayed at dos pilas . tikal counterattacked against dos pilas in , driving b alaj chan k awiil into an exile that lasted five years . calakmul tried to encircle tikal within an area dominated by its allies , such as el peru , dos pilas and caracol . in , jasaw chan k awiil i erected the first dated monument at tikal in years and claimed the title of kaloomte , so ending the hiatus . he initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on calakmul when , in , he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered . after this , calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory . tikal after teotihuacn by the th century , there was no active teotihuacan presence at any maya site and the center of teotihuacan had been razed by . even after this , formal war attire illustrated on monuments was teotihuacan style . jasaw chan k awiil i and his heir yik in chan k awiil continued hostilities against calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around tikal , extending as far as the territory around lake petn itz . these two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today . in , quirigu , a vassal of copn , tikal s key ally in the south , switched allegiance to calakmul , defeated copn and gained its own independence . it appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of calakmul to bring about the collapse of tikal s southern allies . this upset the balance of power in the southern maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of copn . in the th century , the rulers of tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the north acropolis . by the late th century and early th century , activity at tikal slowed . impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers . terminal classic by the th century , the crisis of the classic maya collapse was sweeping across the region , with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence . increasingly endemic warfare in the maya region caused tikal s supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself , accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline . construction continued at the beginning of the century , with the erection of temple , the last of the city s major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the th k atun in . the beginning of the th bak tun in passed uncelebrated , and marks the beginning of a year hiatus , probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city . during this hiatus , satellite sites traditionally under tikal s control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the mutal emblem glyph , with tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence . in , jewel k awiil is mentioned on a stela at seibal as visiting that city as the divine lord of tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and tikal s once great power was little more than a memory . the sites of ixlu and jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive mutal emblem glyph . as tikal and its hinterland reached peak population , the area suffered deforestation , erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels . tikal and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from to and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly . there is not much evidence from tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the maya region during the terminal classic , although an influx of refugees from the petexbatn region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources . in the latter half of the th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of tikal , as evidenced by a stela erected in the great plaza by jasaw chan k awiil ii in . this was the last monument erected at tikal before the city finally fell into silence . the former satellites of tikal , such as jimbal and uaxactun , did not last much longer , erecting their final monuments in . by the end of the th century the vast majority of tikal s population had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city s ceremonial plazas . the squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non utilitarian items such as musical instruments . these inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them . some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations . before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared , with the tombs of the north acropolis being explored for jade and the easier to find tombs being looted . after , tikal was all but deserted , although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins . even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the th or th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next thousand years . some of tikal s population may have migrated to the peten lakes region , which remained heavily populated in spite of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the th century . the most likely cause of collapse at tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure . the fall of tikal was a blow to the heart of classic maya civilization , the city having been at the forefront of courtly life , art and architecture for over a thousand years , with an ancient ruling dynasty . however , new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of tikal . modern history in , the spanish conquistador hernn corts passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of tikal but did not mention them in his letters . after spanish friar andrs de avendao became lost in the petn forests in early he described a ruin that may well have been tikal . as is often the case with huge ancient ruins , knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region . it seems that local people never forgot about tikal and they guided guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the s . some second or third hand accounts of tikal appeared in print starting in the th century , continuing through the writings of john lloyd stephens in the early th century stephens and his illustrator frederick catherwood heard rumors of a lost city , with white building tops towering above the jungle , during their travels in the region . because of the site s remoteness from modern towns , however , no explorers visited tikal until modesto mndez and ambrosio tut , respectively the commissioner and the governor of petn , visited it in . artist eusebio lara accompanied them and their account was published in germany in . several other expeditions came to further investigate , map , and photograph tikal in the th century including alfred p. maudslay in and the early th century . pioneering archaeologists started to clear , map and record the ruins in the s . in , a small airstrip was built at the ruins , which previously could only be reached by several days travel through the jungle on foot or mule . in the tikal project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the maya area . from through , major archaeological excavations were carried out by the university of pennsylvania tikal project . they mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures . excavations directed by edwin m. shook and later by william coe of the university investigated the north acropolis and the central plaza from to . the tikal project recorded over monuments at the site . in , the guatemalan government began a further archeological project at tikal , which continued through to . filmmaker george lucas used tikal as a filming location for the first star wars film , episode iv a new hope , released in . temple i at tikal was featured on the reverse of the centavo banknote . tikal is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park . a site museum has been built at tikal it was completed in . site description tikal has been partially restored by the university of pennsylvania and the government of guatemala . it was one of the largest of the classic period maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the americas . the architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over metres ft high , large royal palaces , in addition to a number of smaller pyramids , palaces , residences , administrative buildings , platforms and inscribed stone monuments . there is even a building which seemed to have been a jail , originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors . there are also seven courts for playing the mesoamerican ballgame , including a set of in the seven temples plaza , a unique feature in mesoamerica . the limestone used for construction was local and quarried on site . the depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to waterproof them and were used as reservoirs , together with some waterproofed natural depressions . the main plazas were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that channelled rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs . the residential area of tikal covers an estimated square kilometres sq mi , much of which has not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated . a huge set of earthworks discovered by dennis e. puleston and donald callender in the s rings tikal with a metre ft wide trench behind a rampart . the square kilometres . sq mi area around the site core has been intensively mapped it may have enclosed an area of some square kilometres sq mi see below . population estimates place the demographic size of the site between , and , , and possibly , in the surrounding area . recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is inconsequential as a defensive feature . in addition , some parts of the earthwork were integrated into a canal system . the earthwork of tikal varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and multifaceted than originally thought . causeways by the late classic , a network of sacbeob causeways linked various parts of the city , running for several kilometres through its urban core . these linked the great plaza with temple located about metres , ft to the west and the temple of the inscriptions about kilometre . mi to the southeast . these broad causeways were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists the maler , maudslay , tozzer and mndez causeways . they assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams . the maler causeway runs north from behind temple i to group h. a large bas relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of group h. it depicts two bound captives and dates to the late classic . the maudsley causeway runs . kilometres . mi northeast from temple iv to group h. the mendez causeway runs southeast from the east plaza to temple vi , a distance of about . kilometres . mi . the tozzer causeway runs west from the great plaza to temple iv . architectural groups the great plaza lies at the core of the site it is flanked on the east and west sides by two great temple pyramids . on the north side it is bordered by the north acropolis and on the south by the central acropolis . the central acropolis is a palace complex just south of the great plaza . the north acropolis , together with the great plaza immediately to the south , is one of the most studied architectural groups in the maya area the tikal project excavated a massive trench across the complex , thoroughly investigating its construction history . it is a complex group with construction beginning in the preclassic period , around bc . it developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the classic period , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures . after ad a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier northern platform , which measured by metres by ft , gradually hiding it from view . eight temple pyramids were built in the th century ad , each of them had an elaborate roofcomb and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods . by the th century ad , stelae and altars had been erected in the north acropolis of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits . the north acropolis continued to receive burials into the postclassic period . the south acropolis is found next to temple v. it was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than , square metres , sq ft . the plaza of the seven temples is to the west of the south acropolis . it is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples , by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side . the mundo perdido is to the west of the plaza of the seven temples . it is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the preclassic period at tikal . the complex was organized as a large e group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples . the mundo perdido complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history . by ad its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of teotihuacan in the valley of mexico , including the use of the talud tablero form . during the early classic period c . the mundo perdido became one of the twin foci of the city , the other being the north acropolis . from ad to it may have served as the royal necropolis . the mundo perdido complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the university of pennsylvania it is centered upon the lost world pyramid and a small platform to the west of it . group g lies just south of the mendez causeway . the complex dates to the late classic and consists of palace type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at tikal . it has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor , a total of vaulted chambers . the remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey . one of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask . group h is centered on a large plaza to the north of the great plaza . it is bordered by temples dating to the late classic . there are nine twin pyramid complexes at tikal , one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed . they vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east west axis . these pyramids are flat topped and have stairways on all four sides . a row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids , and lying roughly equidistant from them , there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair . on the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine doorways . the entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at year or k atun intervals during the late classic . the first twin pyramid complex was built in the early th century in the east plaza . it was once thought that these complexes were unique to tikal but rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as yaxha and ixlu , and they may reflect the extent of tikal s political dominance in the late classic . group q is a twin pyramid complex , and is one of the largest at tikal . it was built by yax nuun ayiin ii in in order to mark the end of the th k atun . most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re erected . group r is another twin pyramid complex , dated to . it is close to the maler causeway . structures there are thousands of ancient structures at tikal and only a fraction of these have been excavated , after decades of archaeological work . the most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids , labelled temples i vi , each of which support a temple structure on their summits . some of these pyramids are over metres feet high . they were numbered sequentially during the early survey of the site . it is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years . temple i also known as the temple of ah cacao or temple of the great jaguar is a funerary pyramid dedicated to jasaw chan k awil , who was entombed in the structure in ad , the pyramid was completed around . the temple rises metres ft high . the massive roofcomb that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king , although little of this decoration survives . the tomb of the king was discovered by aubrey trik of the university of pennsylvania in . among items recovered from the late classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people , finely carved and rubbed with vermilion , as well as jade and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink . the shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers , each behind the next , with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels fashioned from multiple beams . the outermost lintel is plain but the two inner lintels were carved , some of the beams were removed in the th century and their location is unknown , while others were taken to museums in europe . temple ii also known as the temple of the mask it was built around ad and stands metres ft high . like other major temples at tikal , the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels , only the middle of which was carved . the temple was dedicated to the wife of jasaw chan k awil , although no tomb was found . the queen s portrait was carved into the lintel spanning the doorway of the summit shrine . one of the beams from this lintel is now in the american museum of natural history in new york . temple iii also known as the temple of the jaguar priest was the last of the great pyramids to be built at tikal . it stood metres ft tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof lintel , possibly showing dark sun engaged in a ritual dance around ad . the temple shrine possesses two chambers . temple iv is the tallest temple pyramid at tikal , measuring metres ft from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb . temple iv marks the reign of yik in chan kawil ruler b , the son of ruler a or jasaw chan k awiil i and two carved wooden lintels over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid s summit record a long count date . . . . that corresponds to ce sharer . temple iv is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the maya region in the th century , and as it currently stands is the tallest pre columbian structure in the americas although the pyramid of the sun at teotihuacan may originally have been taller , as may have been one of the structures at el mirador . temple v stands south of the central acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler . the temple stands metres ft high , making it the second tallest structure at tikal only temple iv is taller . the temple has been dated to about ad , in the late classic period , via radiocarbon analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of nun bak chak in the second half of the th century . temple vi is also known as the temple of the inscriptions and was dedicated in ad . it is notable for its metre ft high roof comb . panels of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof comb . the temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is unrestored . temple was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of siyaj chan k awiil i known as burial in the north acropolis . it started life in the early classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway . later in the early classic a new superstructure was added , with its own masks and decorated panels . during the hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the structure burial . while the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb burial was inserted into the rubble core of the building . the pyramid was then completed , standing metres ft tall . the final version of temple was completely dismantled by archaeologists in in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction . structure is a pyramid in the north acropolis that was built by siyaj chan k awiil ii over the tomb of his father , yax nuun ayiin i. the pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine , the rooms situated one behind the other . structure d is an unusual radial temple in the east plaza , built over a pre existing twin pyramid complex . it is built into the end of the east plaza ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways , the fourth south side was too close to the central acropolis for a stairway on that side . the building has a talud tablero platform profile , modified from the original style found at teotihuacan . in fact , it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer affinities with el tajin and xochicalco than with teotihuacan itself . the vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols . large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels , related to the venus and star symbols used at teotihuacan . the roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain , showing a monstrous face , perhaps that of a jaguar , with another head emerging from the mouth . the second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake . the temple , and its associated ballcourt , probably date to the reign of nuun ujol chaak or that of his son jasaw chan k awiil i , in the later part of the th century . structure c possesses a clear teotihuacan linked architectural style it has balustrades , an architectural feature that is very rare in the maya region , and a talud tablero faade it dates to the th century ad . it is located near to the lost world pyramid . structure c is a small teotihuacan style platform that dates to about ad . it had stairways on all four sides and did not possess a superstructure . the lost world pyramid structure c is the largest structure in the mundo perdido complex . it lies in the southwest portion of tikal s central core , south of temple iii and west of temple v. it was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the late preclassic this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un impacted by later building activity at tikal . by the end of the late preclassic this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the maya region . it attained its final form during the reign of chak tok ich aak in the th century ad , in the early classic , standing more than metres ft high with stairways on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from perishable materials . although the plaza later suffered significant alteration , the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex adheres to the layout that defines the so called e groups , identified as solar observatories . structure d is the central temple on the east side of the plaza of the seven temples . it has been restored and its rear outer wall is decorated with skull and crossbones motifs . group c is an elite residential complex that has been thoroughly excavated . it lies a few hundred metres south of the lost world complex and the excavations have revealed elaborate stucco masks , ballplayer murals , relief sculptures and buildings with teotihuacan characteristics . the great plaza ballcourt is a small ballcourt that lies between temple i and the central acropolis . the bat palace is also known as the palace of windows and lies to the west of temple iii . it has two storeys , with a double range of chambers on the lower storey and a single range in the upper storey , which has been restored . the palace has ancient graffiti and possesses low windows . complex n lies to the west of the bat palace and temple iii . the complex dates to ad . altars altar is carved with two nobles , one of whom is probably jasaw chan k awiil i. they are performing a ritual using the bones of an important woman . altar was found in complex n , which lies to the west of temple iii . altar is sculpted with a bound captive . it was found within complex p in group h and is now in the museo nacional de arqueologa y etnologa in guatemala city . altar is associated with stela and bears the sculpture of a bound captive . it is located in front of temple vi . altar is carved with a captive tied to a scaffold . it is in the northern enclosure of group q , a twin pyramid complex and has suffered from erosion . altar is a plain monument associated with stela . the stela altar pair is centrally located at the base of the stairway of temple iv . lintels at tikal , beams of sapodilla wood were placed as lintels spanning the inner doorways of temples . these are the most elaborately carved wooden lintels to have survived anywhere in the maya region . lintel from temple iv was taken to basel in switzerland in the th century . it was in almost perfect condition and depicts yik in chan k awiil seated on a palanquin . stelae stelae are carved stone shafts , often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs . a selection of the most notable stelae at tikal follows stela dates to the th century and depicts the king siyaj chan k awiil ii in a standing position . stela is dated to ad , during the reign of yax nuun ayiin after the intrusion of teotihuacan in the maya area . the stela displays a mix of maya and teotihuacan qualities , and deities from both cultures . it has a portrait of the king with the underworld jaguar god under one arm and the mexican tlaloc under the other . his helmet is a simplified version of the teotihuacan war serpent . unusually for maya sculpture , but typically for teotihuacan , yax nuun ayiin is depicted with a frontal face , rather than in profile . stela was dedicated in by yik in chan k awiil . stela is a badly damaged monument dating to and bears the name of the lady of tikal who celebrated the end of the th k atun in that year . stela is twinned with stela but is badly damaged . it described the accession of kaloomte b alam in the early th century and earlier events in his career , including the capture of a prisoner depicted on the monument . stela was the last monument ever erected at tikal it was dedicated in by jasaw chan k awiil ii . stela is linked to the queen known as the lady of tikal and king kaloomte b alam . the queen is described as performing the year ending rituals but the monument was dedicated in honor of the king . stela was dedicated in , during the reign of jasaw chan k awiil i. the sculpture , including a portrait of the king and a hieroglyphic text , are limited to the front face of the monument . it was found in complex n , west of temple iii . stela was one of two stelae erected by yax nuun ayiin i to celebrate the k atun ending of ad . it was re erected at the base of temple , his funerary shrine . stela was dedicated in by yax nuun ayiin ii . stela was found in complex p , in group h , and was moved to the museo nacional de arqueologa y etnologa in guatemala city . stela was dedicated in by yik in chan k awiil . only the bottom of the stela is intact , the rest having been mutilated in ancient times . the surviving sculpture is of fine quality , consisting of the feet of a figure and of accompanying hieroglyphic text . the stela is associated with altar and is located in front of temple vi . stela was dedicated in by yax nuun ayiin ii in the northern enclosure of group q , a twin pyramid complex . the face of the figure on the stela has been mutilated . stela was broken in antiquity and was re erected in a residential complex . the defaced portrait on the monument is that of the so called lady of tikal , a daughter of chak tok ich aak ii who became queen at the age of six but never ruled in her own right , being paired with male co rulers . it dates to the early th century . stela was erected at the foot of temple in , accompanied by altar . both were broken into fragments in ancient times , although the name of dark sun survives on three fragments . stela was found in the summit shrine of temple , underneath a broken masonry altar . the monument had originally been erected at the base of the temple during the early classic period and was later broken , probably at the beginning of the late classic . its remains were then interred within the temple shrine . stela bears a long count . . . . date equivalent to ad , the earliest surviving long count date from the maya lowlands . the stela is also the earliest monument to bear the tikal emblem glyph . it bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right , holding the head of an underworld jaguar god , one of the patron deities of the city . the stela was deliberately smashed during the th century or some time later , the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to temple iii , to be uncovered by archaeologists in . stela is the first surviving monument to be erected after the hiatus . its style and iconography is similar to that of caracol , one of the more important of tikal s enemies . stela is the accession monument of siyaj chan k awiil ii , also bearing two portraits of his father , yax nuun ayiin , as a youth dressed as a teotihuacan warrior . he carries a spearthrower in one hand and bears a shield decorated with the face of tlaloc , the teotihuacan war god . in ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of temple and ritually buried . stela has been described as the greatest early classic sculpture to survive at tikal . a long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument , the longest to survive from the early classic , which describes the arrival of siyah k ak at el peru and tikal in january . it was also the first stela at tikal to be carved on all four faces . stela is a fragmented monument with a foreign teotihuacan style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with the attributes of the central mexican storm god tlaloc , including his goggle eyes and tasselled headdress . stela is a broken monument that was erected in the lost world complex . the upper portion of the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of chak tok ich aak , holding a flint axe in his left hand . he is trampling the figure of a bound , richly dressed captive . the monument is dated to ad . the text on the back of the monument describes a bloodletting ritual to celebrate a katun ending . the stela also names chak tok ich aak i s father as k inich muwaan jol . stela bears a portrait of kan chitam and dates to ad . stela is paired with altar . it is a plain monument at the base of the stairway of temple iv . burials burial is a tomb in the lost world complex . a fine ceramic bowl was recovered from the tomb , with the handle formed from three dimensional head and neck of a bird emerging from the two dimensional body painted on the lid . burial is the tomb of yax nuun ayiin . it is located beneath structure in the north acropolis . the tomb contained a rich array of offerings , including ceramic vessels and food , and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king . a dog was also entombed with the deceased king . pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of maya and teotihuacan styles . among the offerings was an incense burner in the shape of an elderly underworld god , sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands . the tomb was sealed with a corbel vault , then the pyramid was built on top . burial is generally accepted as the tomb of siyaj chan k awil . it is located beneath temple in the north acropolis . the chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two adolescents who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler . the walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the long count date equivalent to march , probably the date of either the death or interment of the king . the king s skeleton was missing its skull , its femurs and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact . burial dates to the late preclassic and was enclosed by a platform , with a primitive corbel vault . the tomb contained a single male skeleton , which lacked a skull and its thighbones . the dynastic founder of tikal , yax ehb xook , has been linked to this tomb , which lies deep in the heart of the north acropolis . the deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers . the bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle . the missing head was replaced by a small greenstone mask with shell inlaid teeth and eyes and bearing a three pointed royal headband . this head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare preclassic lowland maya portrait of a king . among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine , a spondylus shell and twenty six ceramic vessels . burial is the tomb of jasaw chan k awiil i. it is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid , below the level of the great plaza . the tomb contained rich offerings of jadeite , ceramics , shell and works of art . the body of the king was covered with large quantities of jade ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads , as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king . one of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate jade mosaic vessel with the lid bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself . burial was flooded with mud in antiquity . this flood had covered wooden objects that had completely rotted away by the time the tomb was excavated , leaving hollows in the dried mud . archaeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god k awiil , the wooden originals long gone . burial is a late classic royal tomb that contained a jade mosaic vessel topped with the head of the maize god . tropical storm josephine tropical storm josephine was the tenth tropical storm of the atlantic hurricane season . josephine developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the african coast on august . the wave quickly became organized and was declared tropical depression ten while located mi km to the south southeast of the cape verde islands on september . the depression was quickly upgraded to tropical storm josephine around noon the same day . over the next several days , josephine moved in a general west northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on september . strong wind shear , some due to the outflow of hurricane ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken . on september , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused josephine to weaken into a tropical depression . josephine deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm . the low ultimately dissipated while located mi km east of guadeloupe on september . however , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of st. croix . meteorological history tropical storm josephine formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of africa near the end of august . it tracked south of cape verde and slowly developed , and on september the disturbance became tropical depression ten while located south southeast of the cape verde islands . as the depression became more organized , an eye like feature developed in the upper levels of the system . the depression was upgraded to tropical storm josephine six hours after forming . josephine was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly . josephine continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical . however , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the national hurricane center was uncertain of its actual intensity . despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification . the storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper level trough diving southward . despite convection being partially removed from the center of josephine , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on september as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized . the intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger . josephine reached its peak intensity of mph km h around a.m. edt as it continued to become more organized . however , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken . outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system . during the afternoon hours , the structure of josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll . by the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center . despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of convection formed in the northern semicircle of josephine . the center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity . the forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the day forecast was predicted . however , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and josephine weakened again . by the afternoon , the center of josephine was only a swirl of clouds , devoid of convection . during the overnight hours on september into the morning of september , convection associated with josephine began to redevelop somewhat , mostly to the north of the circulation , due to the strong southerly wind shear . by mid morning , josephine re intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection . however , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on josephine by late morning . the convection around the system became dislocated from the center and josephine weakened slightly . the weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong southerly shear . josephine became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid afternoon and the storm weakened to mph km h , barely holding on to tropical storm status . josephine regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm . due to the lack of convection , josephine was downgraded to a tropical depression at p.m. edt with winds of mph km h . since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm regenerating over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression . the next morning , josephine was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm . no redevelopment was expected with josephine as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated . however , the remnant low associated with josephine began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on september . convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . on september , wind shear took over the system again . convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . the national hurricane center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . finally , on september , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of josephine deteriorating into an open wave . however , on september , the remnants of josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of josephine headed towards the bahamas . however , on september , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . impact as josephine passed to the south of the cape verde islands on september , outer rain bands produced minor rainfall , totaling around . inches mm . there were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor . several days after the low dissipated , the remnant moisture from josephine brought showers and thunderstorms to st. croix where up to in . mm of rain fell . the heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding . no known damage was caused by the flood . mount elbert mount elbert is the highest summit of the rocky mountains of north america and the highest point in the u.s. state of colorado and the entire mississippi river drainage basin . the ultra prominent , foot . m fourteener is the highest peak in the sawatch range and the second highest summit in the contiguous united states after mount whitney . mount elbert is located in san isabel national forest , . miles . km southwest bearing of the city of leadville in lake county , colorado . the mountain was named in honor of colorado statesman samuel hitt elbert , who was active in the formative period of the state and governor of the territory of colorado from to . henry w. stuckle of the hayden survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak , in . the easiest and most popular climbing routes are categorized as class to or a in mountaineering parlance . mount elbert is therefore often referred to as the gentle giant that tops all others in the rocky mountains . geography mount elbert is visible to the southwest of leadville , often snow capped even in the summer . many other fourteeners surround elbert in all directions , and it is very close to central colorado s collegiate peaks . the neighboring mount massive , to the north , is the second highest peak in the rocky mountains and the third highest in the contiguous united states , and la plata peak , to the south , is the fifth highest in the rockies . the community of twin lakes lies at the base of mount elbert , denver is about miles km to the east , vail is miles km to the north , and aspen is miles km to the west . leadville , about miles km to the northeast , is the nearest large town . elbert s parent peak is mount whitney in california . including alaska and hawaii , mount elbert is the fourteenth highest mountain in the united states . weather conditions often change rapidly , and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summertime hailstorms and snow are possible year round . an electrical storm on the mountain s summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the july issue of science . geology mount elbert is part of the sawatch range , an uplift of the laramide orogeny which separated from the mosquito range to the east around million years ago . the tops of this range were heavily glaciated , leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues . for example , the base of elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded , which lie on a lateral moraine . further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn . there are also lakes to both the north and south , turquoise and twin lakes respectively the twin lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines , and turquoise lake was created by the manmade sugar loaf dam . mount elbert is composed largely of quartzite . however , the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock , which is pre cambrian in origin and about . billion years old . there are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite , as well as bands of gneiss and schist . unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere , elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north facing cirque , which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height , causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation . history mount elbert was named by miners in honor of samuel hitt elbert , the governor of the then territory of colorado , because he brokered a treaty in september with the ute tribe that opened up more than , , acres , km of reservation land to mining and railroad activity . the first recorded ascent of the peak was by h.w. stuckle in , who was surveying the mountain as part of the hayden survey . originally measured as , feet , m in height , mount elbert s elevation was later adjusted to , feet , m following a re evaluation of mapped elevations , which sparked protests . the actual change was made in as a result of the north american vertical datum of it seems the original measurement resulted from the sea level datum of . a matter of some contention arose after the great depression over the heights of elbert and its neighbor , mount massive , which differ in elevation by only feet . m . this led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the mount massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height , only to have the mount elbert proponents demolish them . the effort was ultimately unsuccessful and mount elbert has remained the highest peak in colorado . the first motorized ascent of elbert occurred in , when a jeep was driven to the summit , apparently to judge suitability for skiing development . flora and fauna the summit of mount elbert is an alpine environment , featuring plants such as phacelia sericea sky pilot , hymenoxys grandiflora old man of the mountain , and geum rossii alpine avens . also noted are carex atrata var. pullata , salix desertorum , platanthera hyperborea , thalictrum fendleri , aquilegia canadensis , chenopodium album , gentiana detonsa var. hallii , and bigelovia parryi . below treeline the mountain is heavily forested , with the lower slopes covered with a mixture of lodgepole pine , spruce , aspen and fir . some of the fauna reported on the climb to the summit include black bears , marmots , mule deer , pikas , and pocket gophers there are also many species of avifauna . elk , grouse , turkey and bighorn sheep are present in the area during the summer . climbing there are three main routes which ascend the mountain , all of which gain over , feet , m of elevation . the standard route ascends the peak from the east , starting from the colorado trail just north of twin lakes . the . miles . km long north main elbert trail begins close to the elbert creek campground , and gains about , feet , m . the trail is open to equestrians , mountain bikers and hunters during season . an easier , but longer route , the south elbert trail , is . miles . km long , climbing , feet , m at a less punishing gradient than the north elbert trail , approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge . the most difficult of the main routes is the black cloud trail , a class climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending on pace , gains , feet , m in elevation , and also involves an ascent of the sub peak , south elbert , at , feet , m . even healthy and experienced climbers report great difficulty on this route , and despite the fact that there is a trail , the route is extremely steep , unstable , and rocky in places . the elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the . mile ascent . there are also routes approaching from the western face , and southwestern ridge , from south halfmoon creek trailhead and echo canyon trailhead respectively . although strenuous and requiring physical fitness , none of the conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing . the main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains , particularly altitude sickness . this can affect anyone , even those who are acclimatized . in serious cases , it can lead to high altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema , which can lead to difficulties with breathing , paralysis , and death . climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes . although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking , anna elizabeth dickinson , the orator , ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the u.s. government . scientology in germany the church of scientology has been present in germany since . german authorities estimate that there are , active scientologists in germany today the church of scientology gives a membership figure of around , . the church of scientology has encountered particular antagonism from the german press and government and occupies a precarious legal , social and cultural position in germany . german courts have so far not resolved whether scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or worldview community , and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions . the german domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization s activities . the german government does not recognize scientology as a religion . it views it as an abusive business masquerading as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the german constitution . this stance has been criticized , most notably by the u.s. government , which recognizes scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect filters . scientologists in germany face specific political and economic restrictions . they are barred from membership in some major political parties , and businesses and other employers use so called sect filters to expose a prospective business partner s or employee s association with the organization . german federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning scientology in late , but abandoned the initiative a year later , finding insufficient legal grounds . despite this , polls suggest that most germans favor banning scientology altogether . background scientology , founded in the early s in the united states by l. ron hubbard and today claiming to be represented in countries , has been a very controversial new religious movement . its stated utopian aim is to clear the planet , to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations . scientology teaches that the source of people s unhappiness lies in engrams , psychological burdens acquired in the course of painful experiences , which can be cleared through a type of counselling called auditing made available by the church of scientology . the fact that scientologists have to pay large fees for auditing and other scientology services has brought controversy to scientology throughout much of its history , with governments classing it as a profit making enterprise rather than as a religion . critics maintain that scientology is a business driven , psychologically manipulative , totalitarian ideology with world dominating aspirations , and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for scientology courses . scientology has fought innumerable lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion . these efforts have been partly successful scientology has gained recognition as a tax exempt religious group in a number of countries , most notably in australia in and the united states in , and in won an important case at the european court of human rights , which censured russia for failing to register scientology as a religion . the german government has said that it does not consider scientology a religion , but a commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism whose totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to germany s democratic society . accordingly , the german government has taken a very strong stance against the organization . germany is not alone in opposing scientology in france , the church of scientology was convicted of organized fraud in october , after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for scientology products , and the church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether . scientology is similarly controversial in belgium , greece and the uk . on the subject of scientology s status as a religion , the german government has pointed to a decision by the federal labor court of germany . that court , noting hubbard s instruction that scientologists should make money , make more money make other people produce so as to make more money , came to the conclusion that scientology purports to be a church merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests . in the same decision , the court also found that scientology uses inhuman and totalitarian practices . given the lessons of germany s th century history , in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power . references in scientology writings to the elimination of parasites and antisocial people who stand in the way of progress towards scientology s utopian world without insanity , without criminals and without war evoke uncomfortable parallels with nazism , and have led to scientology being classified as an extremist political movement . to further justify its stance , the german government has also pointed to the long history of u.s. court cases involving scientology , including the conviction of top scientologists in and for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of u.s. government agencies , wiretapping and the theft of government documents , a u.s. supreme court finding that scientology practices took place in a coercive environment , and scientology s track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators . in examining the potential threat posed by scientology the german government has noted that scientology organizations are structured so as to make the individual psychologically and financially dependent on a scientology system , and that members often abandon contact with friends and family . history scientology presence in germany scientology first became active in germany in . by , there were ten major centres scientology churches , as well as fourteen minor centres scientology missions in germany . the german scientology churches are located in the big cities munich , hamburg , berlin , dsseldorf , frankfurt am main , hanover and stuttgart . of the scientology missions , nine are in baden wrttemberg , and three in bavaria . following german re unification , scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former german democratic republic most adherents are found in baden wrttemberg , bavaria and north rhine westphalia . scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or vereine in germany their umbrella organisation is the scientology kirche deutschland e.v. germany s domestic intelligence service , the bundesamt fr verfassungsschutz bfv , or federal office for the protection of the constitution , estimates that there are , scientologists in germany , down from earlier estimates of , to , . the church of scientology reported around , members from the mid s onwards this number remained stable for many years . however more recently scientology has said it has only , members . discrepancies in scientology membership numbers arise because the church of scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement . the number of contractually bound scientology staff members working in german scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred . scientology formulated a clear germany strategy in similar to equivalent strategies pursued by scientology in other countries and regions of the world with the long term aim of transforming german society in line with the scientological ideal a non pluralist society in which scientology enjoys overriding influence . the programme sought to address scientology s image problems in germany , to identify weak points in germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as germany s national socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in german society , with a special emphasis on manoeuvring scientologists into key positions in industry and government . as most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in . however , according to the bfv , the strategy has not had any significant success . by , government officials had been suspected of being scientologists and in cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise scientology . according to fifka sydora , it is unknown to what degree the clear germany programme is still being pursued . public opposition german public discourse does not regard scientology as a religion , but generally characterizes it as a sekte cult or sect , or as an exploitative profit making venture preying on vulnerable minds . public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early s , when widespread debate took place about youth religions such as the unification church , iskcon , children of god , and the divine light mission . the most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the sect commissioners sektenbeauftragte of germany s protestant churches , who also actively promoted the establishment of private initiatives of parents and concerned persons . aktion bildungsinformation educational information campaign became an important organization dedicated to opposing scientology taking an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with scientology , filed successful lawsuits against the church of scientology over its proselytizing in public places , and published an influential book , the sect of scientology and its front organizations . in , the organization s founder , ingo heinemann , became the director of aktion fr geistige und psychische freiheit campaign for intellectual and psychic freedom , germany s most prominent anti cult organization . warnings from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation as the movements were not doing anything illegal , the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious sects , the earliest of these publications appearing in . fueled by events such as the waco siege in , the murders and suicides associated with the order of the solar temple , and the aum shinrikyo incidents in japan , german fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the s , with scientology attracting particular attention . perceptions that scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when robert vaughn young , an american ex scientologist and former pr official in the church of scientology , visited german officials in late and wrote an article in der spiegel , a widely read weekly magazine , describing scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag the rehabilitation project force for members of scientology s sea org found guilty of transgressions . from the mid s onward , press articles , reports and essays on scientology appeared on an almost daily basis , accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience . as noted by the religious scholar hubert seiwert , scientology came to be seen as a serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state . this view of scientology as a public enemy , seiwert adds , became a matter of political correctness senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against scientology , and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism . stephen a. kent , writing in , noted that officials at all levels of german government shared the insistence that scientology should be suppressed . scientology was viewed as a totalitarian , business driven organization ... guilty of significant human rights abuses . officials examining primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the organization was antithetical to a democratic state . federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of scientology . government publications on the dangers of sects increased between and , and a significant number of them dealt with the church of scientology . the german courts had approved such publications in , seeing them as part of the government s responsibility to keep the public informed , and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom . in , the german parliament launched an enquete enquiry commission to investigate sects and similar groups , in large part because of public concerns about scientology . its final report , published in june , concluded that scientology , alone among new religious movements , required monitoring by germany s domestic intelligence services . an area of widespread concern in the german media has been the alleged infiltration of businesses by scientologists , in line with scientology s declared aim to penetrate society , politics and business in preparation for world domination . attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium size companies , such as estate agents , management consultants and management training companies . management consultancy firms led by scientologists often conceal their association with scientology once they have recruited members of their clients upper management , these managers may send employees to scientology trainers , as part of company education and training programmes , without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used . an expensive commercial version of scientology s oxford capacity analysis , usually offered free as part of scientology proselytizing in public places , temporarily entered some major german companies who were unaware of its provenance via such a management consultancy firm . in the mid s , german sect experts expressed concerns that scientologists were becoming active in the german after school tutoring market . these concerns arose because customers of around after school tutoring centres operated by scientologists in frankfurt , hamburg , stuttgart and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by scientologists , using scientology methods . brochures advertising the tutoring services would at most mention the name of l. ron hubbard , the founder of scientology , but not scientology itself . in early , thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the german lutheran church in berlin and brandenburg , and the historian guido knopp both likened the scientologist hollywood actor tom cruise to goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister . gandow and knopp cited a leaked scientology video in which cruise was seen asking the audience whether scientologists should clean up the world , the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers cheers which gandow and knopp felt were reminiscent of the audience s response to goebbels famous question , do you want total war gandow s and knopp s comments found few critics in germany . most germans consider scientology a subversive organization . in , time reported that of germans favoured banning scientology a poll conducted in september by der spiegel found support for a ban . german scholars such as brigitte schn and gerald willms have commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around scientology in germany in their view , efforts to frame information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities . in schn s words , this includes both the efforts of german politicians to enhance their popularity with strong worded statements and scientology s efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution commenting on foreign reporting on scientology in germany , she adds that the american press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to american stereotypes . both willms and schn assert that the situation is compounded by the general paucity of scientific studies of scientology . schn as well as irving hexham , professor of religious studies at the university of calgary in canada , have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by german scholars . hexham attributes this situation to the strong influence of the christian churches in germany , which has made german academics wary of approaching the subject , because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate . in a german public broadcaster , ard , showed the film until nothing remains , a dramatized account of the effect scientology had on one german family . said to be based on a true story , the film attracted widespread media attention and a viewership of . million . legal status while there have been calls for scientology to be banned , the church of scientology remains legal in germany and is allowed to operate there . its precise legal status however is unresolved . two points are contested first , whether or not the teachings of scientology qualify as a religion or worldview religion or weltanschauung these are equal before german law , and secondly , whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity if the latter were the case , this would most likely imply that scientology would not qualify for protection as a religious or worldview community religions oder weltanschauungsgemeinschaft under article of the german constitution , which guarantees the freedom of belief , religion and worldview . status as a religious or worldview community also affects a broad range of other issues in germany , such as taxation and freedom of association . the federal court of justice of germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in that scientology represented a religious or worldview community . the upper administrative court in hamburg explicitly asserted in that scientology should be viewed as a worldview community . in , the federal labor court of germany decided that the church of scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or worldview community entitled to protection under article of the german constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again in . in another decision , the administrative court of baden wrttemberg in mannheim said there were no indications that the teachings of scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity . in , the federal administrative court of germany explicitly granted a scientologist protection under article . of the german constitution , which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate . many courts have declined to assess the religious status of scientology , finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand . the federal administrative court for example ruled in that the question whether or not scientology was a religion was irrelevant , and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities . the german government does not consider the church of scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that scientology is a profit making enterprise , rather than a religion . recent years have seen a number of court decisions in scientology s favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to scientology among politicians and the general public . government surveillance given the history of nazism s rise to power in germany in the s , the present german state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the german constitution . the bfv domestic intelligence service bundesamt fr verfassungsschutz , or federal office for the protection of the constitution regards the aims of scientology as running counter to germany s free and democratic order , and has been monitoring scientology since , as have the offices for the protection of the constitution in a number of german lnder . minister for family policy claudia nolte instituted the surveillance , saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose scientology with all the means at her disposal . the german church of scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court . in december , the administrative court in berlin ruled against the berlin office for the protection of the constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the church of scientology berlin as paid informants . the court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate . in , the same court ruled that it was illegal for the berlin office for the protection of the constitution to include the activities of scientology in its report , given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution . at the federal level , scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the bfv in november . the federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of scientology , as outlined by l. ron hubbard in his writings , were incompatible with the german constitution . lawyers acting for the federal office for the protection of the constitution pointed out that hubbard had written that civil rights , for example , should be restricted to scientologists , and they asserted that the scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti scientology legislation . opposing counsel acting for the church of scientology had contended that scientology was non political , its aims were the liberation of the human being , and that hubbard s instructions were valid only within the church of scientology and were subject to interpretation , and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in germany . the court disagreed and ruled that many sources , some of them not accessible to the general public , indicated that the aims of the church of scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights . in saarland , surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in , because there is no local branch of scientology and few members . as of may , the church of scientology in germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the bfv after the north rhine westphalia higher administrative court in mnster refused to hear an appeal on the matter . being suspected of maintaining ambitions against the free , democratic basic order , the scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its bylaws . there is at least one example of surveillance of scientology by the german intelligence services outside of germany . in , the swiss government detained an agent of the german government , charging him with carrying out illegal business for a foreign state , working for a political information service and falsifying identity documents . the german government posted bail for the agent . he was eventually given a day suspended jail sentence for spying on scientology , and the german government apologized to switzerland for the incident . sect filters a sect filter , also known as a protective declaration schutzerklrung , is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract . such sect filters , primarily used to screen out scientologists , have been drafted by german government agencies for use by businesses . sect commissioner s offices exist in germany as part of regional or local government . a work instruction introduced in requires government staff in the arbeitsmter local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the federal ministry of labour and social affairs to mark companies owned by scientologists with the letter s . where companies are suspected of having scientologist staff , prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff . government officials have publicised the names of individual scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses some businesspeople have placed advertisements in the press saying they are not scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma . due to concerns about possible government infiltration by scientologists , applicants for civil service positions in bavaria are required to declare whether or not they are scientologists , and a similar policy has been instituted in hesse . companies tendering for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not scientologists in , this requirement was changed , and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that the technology of l. ron hubbard will not be used in executing the contract . when it became known that microsoft s windows operating system included a disk defragmenter developed by executive software international a company headed by a scientologist , this caused concern among german government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage . to assuage these concerns , microsoft germany agreed to provide a means to disable the utility . following letters of complaint about discrimination from scientology lawyers , some american companies such as general electric , ibm and ford motor company instructed their german subsidiaries to cease the use of protective declarations . the city state of hamburg set up a full time office dedicated to opposing scientology , the scientology task force for the hamburg interior authority , under the leadership of ursula caberta . in , in a case brought by a scientologist , the federal administrative court of germany ordered the city of hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community , finding that the practice infringed religious freedom . in june , the hamburg administrative court fined the city of hamburg , euros , for not complying with court instructions banning the use of sect filters . internet links to sample filters to be used by businesses had continued to remain available . eileen barker , a professor of sociology at the london school of economics , has noted that germany has gone further than any other western european country in restricting the civil rights of scientologists . the hamburg task force was closed down in august as a result of budget cuts caberta moved to a position within the hamburg interior authority , where she continues her work on scientology . scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties in germany such as the christian democratic union , the christian social union of bavaria , the social democratic party of germany and the free democratic party . existing scientologist members of these parties have been purged , according to time magazine . scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in germany scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked . in , a sports scientist and former member of the german national fencing team was dismissed from his job at the german olympic fencing centre after he stated in an interview that he had enjoyed reading books by l. ron hubbard and had participated in a course run by a scientologist management and communication consultancy firm . thomas gottschalk , a german tv presenter , was falsely accused in of having taken part in scientology courses gottschalk responded by announcing that he had not , and that he would henceforth cease all contact with a friend who had links to scientology . in , gnther oettinger , the minister president of the german state of baden wrttemberg , expressed concern that scientologist john travolta was to appear on gottschalk s programme , and asked the zdf tv station to consider revoking the invitation the zdf said that uninviting travolta would cause greater damage , and that scientology was not going to be discussed in the programme . in , the bavarian administrative court ruled that a woman working in a children s daycare centre , whose employment had been terminated when her ex husband identified her as a scientologist , should be reinstated . the woman had demonstrated to the court s satisfaction that her scientological beliefs were irrelevant to her work . according to the agreement that concluded the case , she promised not to use scientology methods in her work , and to inform the children s parents of her membership in scientology . initiative to ban scientology in march , it was reported that german authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor scientology in response to the opening of a new scientology headquarters in berlin . on december , , german federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti constitutional goals , restricting essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment , and asked germany s domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization . the move was criticized by german politicians from all sides of the political spectrum , with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts . sabine weber , president of the church of scientology in berlin , called the accusations unrealistic and absurd and said that the german interior ministers evaluation was based on a few sentences out of , pages of scientological literature . she added , i can also find hundreds of quotes in the bible that are totalitarian but that doesn t mean i will demand the ban of christianity . in november , the government abandoned its attempts to ban scientology , after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity . the report by the bfv cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban scientology doubtful . first , the bfv report stated there was no evidence that scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization there were german churches and missions , a german board , german bylaws , and no evidence that the organization was totally remote controlled from the united states . a foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a german one . the second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was scientology s aggressive opposition to the constitution . here , the report found that scientology s behaviour gave no grounds to assume that scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow germany s free and democratic basic order . neither its bylaws nor any other utterances supported the conclusion that the organization had criminal aims . the bfv also considered whether there were grounds to act against the church of scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning . commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt , ehrhart krting , berlin s interior minister , said , this organization pursues goals through its writings , its concept and its disrespect for minorities that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution . but they put very little of this into practice . the appraisal of the government at the moment is that scientology is a lousy organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to . the church of scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as the only one possible . monitoring of scientology s activities by the german intelligence services continues . in february , the berlin administrative court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the berlin scientology headquarters , warning passers by of the potential dangers scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom , should be removed . the decision was upheld in july by the upper administrative court of berlin brandenburg which ruled that the poster violated scientologists basic religious rights . criticism of germany s stance the united states media , while generally reporting negatively on scientology in domestic news , has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards scientology in relation to germany . richard cohen for example , writing in the washington post , said in scientology might be one weird religion , but the german reaction to it is weirder still not to mention disturbing . alan cowell , writing in the new york times , wrote in that the german response to scientology motivated by officials fear that scientology was a totalitarian movement growing , like the nazi party , from inconsequential beginnings was itself redolent of the nazi era s authoritarianism . the u.s. department of state has repeatedly claimed that germany s actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of scientologists individual rights posed by sect filters . the u.s. department of state began to include the issue of scientology in germany in its annual human rights reports after the agreement between the church of scientology and the u.s. internal revenue service , through which scientology gained the status of a tax exempt religion in the united states . that decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the church of scientology in washington , using paid lobbyists . the state department s human rights report on germany , released in january , warned that artists and businesses with scientology connections may face boycotts and discrimination , sometimes with government approval . past targets of such actions had included scientologist actors tom cruise and john travolta , as well as jazz pianist chick corea . also in january , an open letter to then chancellor helmut kohl appeared , published as a newspaper advertisement in the international herald tribune , drawing parallels between the organized oppression of scientologists in germany and nazi policies espoused by germany in the s . the letter was conceived and paid for by hollywood lawyer bertram fields , whose clients have included tom cruise and john travolta , and was signed by prominent figures in the u.s. entertainment industry , including the top executives of mgm , warner bros. , paramount , universal and sony pictures entertainment as well as actors dustin hoffman and goldie hawn , director oliver stone , writers mario puzo and gore vidal and talk show host larry king . it echoed similar parallels drawn by the church of scientology itself , which until then had received scant notice , and was followed by lobbying efforts of scientology celebrities in washington . u.s. department of state spokesman nicholas burns rejected the nazi comparisons in the open letter as outrageous and distanced the u.s. government from nazi comparisons made by the church of scientology , saying , we have criticized the germans on this , but we aren t going to support the scientologists terror tactics against the german government . chancellor kohl , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it don t know a thing about germany and don t want to know . german officials argued that the whole fuss was cranked up by the scientologists to achieve what we won t give them tax exempt status as a religion . this is intimidation , pure and simple . officials explained that precisely because of germany s nazi past , germany took a determined stance against all radical cults and sects , including right wing nazi groups , and not just against scientology . kohl s christian democratic union party denounced the letter as absurd and cited german court rulings stating that scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a contemptuous cartel of oppression . in february , a united states immigration court judge granted asylum to a german scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland . in april , john travolta met personally with u.s. president bill clinton at a conference in philadelphia . travolta later said clinton assured him that he would really love to help with the issue over in germany with scientology . according to travolta , clinton recalled that he had a roommate years ago who was a scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views on it , stating that scientologists were given an unfair hand in germany and that he wanted to fix it . in september , john travolta , chick corea and fellow scientologist isaac hayes were heard by the commission on security and cooperation in europe csce , also known as the helsinki commission , voicing their complaints about the treatment of scientologists in germany , and had a briefing with united states national security advisor sandy berger , whom clinton had assigned to be the administration s scientology point person . the german ambassador responded with a letter to the csce stating that the german government had come to the conclusion that scientology s pseudo scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals mental and physical health and that it exploits its members , adding that membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency , to financial ruin , and even to suicide . in addition , there are indications that scientology poses a threat to germany s basic political principles . a united nations report in april raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect filters . however , it rejected the comparison of the treatment of scientologists with that of jews during the nazi era . in , the german stern magazine published the results of its investigation of the asylum case . it asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her asylum application ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a scientologist had in fact been written by fellow scientologists at her request and that of scientology s office of special affairs , and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax evasion at the time she applied for asylum . on a visit to clearwater , florida , ursula caberta of the scientology task force for the hamburg interior authority likewise alleged that the asylum case had been part of an orchestrated effort by scientology undertaken for political gain , and a spectacular abuse of the u.s. system . german expatriate scientologists resident in clearwater , in turn , accused caberta of stoking a hate campaign in germany that had ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of scientologists and maintained that scientologists had not exaggerated their plight for political gain in the united states . mark rathbun , a former top church of scientology official , said that although scientology had not orchestrated the case , there would have been nothing improper if it had . in , joachim gntner , writing in the swiss neue zrcher zeitung , noted that gerhard besier , a german christian theologian , director of the hannah arendt institute for research into totalitarianism in dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from lund university , sweden , for his championing of religious freedom , had been pressured to forego publication of his scientific study of scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the german media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards scientology . gntner concluded that alarmism had triumphed over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in germany s ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter . the u.s. department of state s report on religious freedom in germany , published in , stated that the status of the church of scientology remains in limbo . the constitutional court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that scientology is a religion . government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against scientology as a group and against its members . four of the major political parties the christian democratic union , christian social union , social democratic party , and free democratic party ban scientologists from party membership . ... scientologists reported instances of governmental discrimination . although courts at the state and federal level condemned the improper use of so called sect filters to blacklist and boycott scientologists , they remained in use in the public sector . sect filters typically asked potential new employees to confirm in writing that they had no contact with scientology , did not participate in its training courses , and rejected its doctrines . ... catholic and protestant churches continued to oppose scientology publically sic , although press reporting and public reactions to scientology decreased . several private organizations issued warnings about after school study programs run by scientologists . scholarly sources journalistic sources

japanese battleship asahi asahi , asahi was a pre dreadnought battleship built for the imperial japanese navy ijn in the late s . as japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself , the ship was designed and built in the united kingdom . shortly after her arrival in japan , she became flagship of the standing fleet , the ijn s primary combat fleet . she participated in every major naval battle of the russo japanese war of and was lightly damaged during the battle of the yellow sea and the battle of tsushima . asahi saw no combat during world war i , although the ship participated in the siberian intervention in . reclassified as a coastal defence ship in , asahi was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the washington naval treaty , after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship . she was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in . asahi was recommissioned in late , after the start of the second sino japanese war , and used to transport japanese troops . in , she was converted into a repair ship and based first at japanese occupied shanghai , china , and then cam ranh bay , french indochina , from late to . the ship was transferred to occupied singapore in early to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in may . she was sunk en route by the american submarine uss salmon , although most of her crew survived . background combat experience in the first sino japanese war of convinced the imperial japanese navy of weaknesses in the jeune cole naval philosophy , which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships . therefore , japan promulgated a ten year naval build up in early , to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations , with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core . these ships were paid for from the , , indemnity paid by china after losing the first sino japanese war . as with the earlier fuji and shikishima classes , japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships , and turned again to the united kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme . asahi , the fifth japanese battleship to be built in britain , was ordered from the clydebank engineering shipbuilding company shipyard in clydebank , scotland in the annual naval programme . design and description asahi s design was a modified version of the formidable class battleships of the royal navy , with two additional inch mm guns . the ship had an overall length of feet inches . m , a beam of feet . m , and a normal draught of feet inches . m . she displaced , long tons , t at normal load . asahi had a complete double bottom with

. the ship was powered by two vertical triple expansion steam engines built by humphrys , tennant , each driving one propeller , using steam generated by belleville boilers at a working pressure of . bar , kpa psi . the engines were rated at , indicated horsepower , kw , using forced draught , and designed to reach a top speed of knots km h mph although asahi reached . knots . km h . mph from , indicated horsepower , kw during her sea trials on march . she carried a maximum of , long tons , t of coal which allowed her to steam for , nautical miles , km , mi at a speed of knots km h mph . the ship was fitted with three steam driven . kilowatt . hp dynamos . asahi s main battery consisted of the same four elswick ordnance company calibre twelve inch guns used in all of japan s preceding battleships . they were mounted in twin gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . the hydraulically powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of traverse , at a fixed elevation of . . each mount could traverse a total of degrees . they fired pound kg projectiles at a muzzle velocity of , ft s m s . the ship s secondary armament consisted of fourteen calibre inch mm quick firing qf guns mounted in casemates . eight of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other six guns were placed above them in the superstructure . they fired pound kg shells at a

was also equipped with four submerged inch torpedo tubes , two on each broadside . the waterline main belt of asahi consisted of harvey armour feet . m high , of which feet inches . m was above the waterline at normal load , and had a maximum thickness of inches mm for the middle feet . m of the ship . it was only inches mm thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six inch strake of armour that ran between the barbettes . the barbettes were inches mm thick , but only inches mm behind the upper armour strake . the barbette hoods were protected by inches of armour on their face while their sides were inches thick and the roof was . inches mm thick . diagonal bulkheads connecting the barbettes to the side armour were inches thick , but only inches thick at the lower deck level . the frontal armour of the casemates protecting the secondary armament was also inches thick with the rear protected by inch mm armour plates . the flat portion of the deck armour was . inches mm thick and inches mm thick where it sloped down to the sides of the ship . the conning tower was protected by inches of armour . asahi , like all the other japanese battleships of the time , was fitted with four barr and stroud fa coincidence rangefinders that had an effective range of , yards , m . the ships were also fitted with power magnification telescopic gunsights . construction and career asahi , meaning rising sun , a poetic name for japan from a stanza of waka poetry , was laid down on august in clydebank , scotland , by the clydebank engineering shipbuilding co. and completed by john brown company , which purchased the firm before asahi was completed . she was launched on march and completed on july . her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off southsea following sea trials . the ship departed england , after repairs in portsmouth , on the day of her completion , and arrived at yokosuka , japan , on october . asahi became flagship of the standing fleet on may and was assigned to the st battleship division of the st fleet when the combined fleet was re formed on december . at the start of the russo japanese war , asahi , commanded by captain hikohachi yamada , was assigned to the st division of the st fleet . she participated in the battle of port arthur on february , when vice admiral tg heihachir led the st fleet in an attack on the russian ships of the pacific squadron anchored just outside port arthur . tg had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . the japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser boyarin , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the russian defences . tg chose to attack the russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the japanese eight inch mm and six inch guns inflicted little damage on the russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the japanese ships with some effect . although many ships on both sides were hit , russian casualties numbered only , while the japanese suffered killed and wounded before tg disengaged . asahi was not hit during the engagement . the ship participated in the action of april , when tg successfully lured out a portion of the pacific squadron , including vice admiral stepan makarov s flagship , the battleship petropavlovsk . when makarov spotted the five battleships of the st division , he turned back for port arthur and petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by the japanese the previous night . the russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded , and makarov was one of the killed . emboldened by his success , tg resumed long range bombardment missions , prompting the russians to lay more minefields , which sank two japanese battleships the following month . during the battle of the yellow sea on august , asahi , now commanded by captain tsunaakira nomoto , was second in line of the column of japanese battleships , behind mikasa , and was one of the primary targets of the russian ships . she was only hit by a single inch shell that wounded two crewmen . both guns in her aft inch gun turret , however , were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels . in turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships poltava and tsesarevich although both ships were only lightly damaged by the japanese shells , which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact . the ship made the critical hits of the battle , however , when two of her inch shells struck the bridge of tsesarevich , killing the russian squadron commander , vice admiral wilgelm vitgeft , two of his staff officers and the ship s quartermaster . the ship s wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the russian ships into total confusion . the second in command , rear admiral prince pavel ukhtomsky , eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to port arthur . slightly more than two months later , on october , asahi struck a mine off port arthur while on blockade duty . severely damaged , she was under repair at sasebo naval arsenal from november to april . russian naval forces in the far east had been destroyed or neutralized by this time and the russians were forced to transfer ships from the baltic fleet that did not arrive until may . battle of tsushima at the battle of tsushima on may , asahi again followed the battleship mikasa into combat , this time against the second and third pacific squadrons . mikasa opened fire at the battleship knyaz suvorov , the russian flagship , at , and was joined by asahi and the armoured cruiser azuma shortly afterwards . within an hour the japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the russian ship , badly wounded the fleet commander , vice admiral zinovy rozhestvensky , knocked out her rear inch gun turret , and jammed knyaz suvorov s steering so that she fell out of formation . the russian ships were concentrating their fire on mikasa during the early part of the battle and asahi was not damaged during this time . tg was able to cross the t of the russian squadrons . knyaz suvorov s steering was later repaired , but she blundered between the japanese and russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged . asahi seems to have mostly engaged the battleships borodino and oryol in the late stages of the battle , although fuji fired the shots that caused the borodino s magazines to explode and sink her . asahi fired more twelve inch shells , , than any other ship during the battle . in total , the ship was hit six times during the battle , but none of them damaged her significantly . while asahi s casualties are not precisely known , the japanese only lost men killed and wounded to all causes during the battle . the battle was a total japanese victory with five russian battleships captured and incorporated into the ijn . captain w. c. pakenham , the royal navy s official military observer under the anglo japanese alliance , took notes of the battle s progress from a deck chair on asahi s exposed quarterdeck . his report confirmed the superiority of japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the west . later career in , asahi was part of the japanese fleet that escorted the american great white fleet through japanese waters during its round the globe voyage . the ship was assigned to the st fleet in and . asahi became a gunnery training ship in , and was re armed in with japanese guns replacing her original british made guns . the same year , she was assigned to the th division of the rd fleet . in , asahi became flagship of her division and participated in the japanese intervention in the russian civil war . she escorted troop convoys to the russian far east and was guard ship at kamchatka from january to august . asahi was reclassified as a first class coastal defence ship on september , and began disarmament in at yokosuka in compliance with the terms of the washington naval treaty . she was reclassified as a training and submarine depot ship on april and her disarmament was completed in july of that same year . her displacement dropped to , long tons , t with the loss of her armour and guns , and her speed was limited to knots km h mph . the navy decided to convert asahi into a submarine salvage ship and she began the first stage of her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from february to august . from to october , the ship s belleville boilers were replaced with four kanpon type ro boilers at kure naval arsenal . one of her two funnels was also removed , and two large lifting frames were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion . the ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old german submarine ex u . in may , asahi was fitted with a foot inch m compressed air aircraft catapult on her forecastle and successfully launched an en type seaplane . after repeated accidents , the catapult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder . on the completion of testing in , asahi was placed in reserve . reclassified as a repair ship on august , asahi was taken out of reserve in november , after the marco polo bridge incident that started the second sino japanese war , and was used as a transport to land troops in an amphibious landing at hangzhou bay . afterwards she began conversion at kure , japan , into a repair ship this was completed on december . asahi was fitted with a dummy wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in shanghai on december . in may she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between may and november . she was transferred to camranh bay , french indochina , on november and later transported the th base unit from kure to camranh bay november december . from march , asahi was stationed at singapore , and in april her crew performed repairs on the light cruiser naka , which had been torpedoed by the submarine uss seawolf off christmas island . departing singapore for kure on may , escorted by the subchaser ch , asahi was sighted by the submarine uss salmon on the night of may , miles km southeast of cape padaran , indochina . of salmon s four torpedoes , two hit the ship in her port central boiler room and aft spaces . at , moments after being hit , asahi sank at n e.

c. w. beckham john crepps wickliffe beckham august , january , was the th governor of kentucky and a united states senator from kentucky . he was the state s first popularly elected senator following passage of the seventeenth amendment . descended from a prominent political family , beckham was chosen as democrat william goebel s running mate in the gubernatorial election of despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so . goebel lost the election to republican william s. taylor , but the kentucky general assembly disputed the election results . during the political wrangling that followed , an unknown assassin shot goebel . a day later the general assembly invalidated enough votes to give the election to goebel , who was sworn into office on his deathbed . taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the democratic majority in the general assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and beckham over the governorship . beckham ultimately prevailed and taylor fled the state . following his term as governor , beckham made a bid to become a u.s. senator . his stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party and the seat went to republican william o. bradley . six years later beckham secured the seat by popular election , but he lost his re election bid largely because of his pro temperance views and his opposition to women s suffrage . though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades , he never returned to elected office , failing in his gubernatorial bid in and his senatorial campaign in . he died in louisville on january , . early life j. c. w. beckham was born at wickland , near bardstown in nelson county , kentucky , son of william netherton and julia tevis wickliffe beckham . his maternal grandfather , charles a. wickliffe , was governor of kentucky from to and served as postmaster general in the administration of john tyler . his uncle , robert c. wickliffe , served as governor of louisiana . beckham obtained his early education at roseland academy in bardstown . in he served as a page in the kentucky house of representatives at the age of . later , he enrolled at central university now eastern kentucky university in richmond , kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of to support his widowed mother . two years later , he became principal of bardstown public schools , serving from to . concurrently , he studied law at the university of kentucky , where he earned his law degree in . he was admitted to the bar , and commenced practice in bardstown in . he also served as president of the young democrats club of nelson county . political career beckham s political career began in when he was elected without opposition to the kentucky house of representatives . he served four consecutive terms and was speaker of the house in , his final year in the house . he also served as a delegate to every democratic national convention from to . governor of kentucky democrat william goebel chose beckham as his running mate in the kentucky gubernatorial election of . goebel was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election , and beckham s native nelson county was already committed to a rival candidate . but friends of goebel assured him that beckham would be loyal to goebel s reform agenda , whereas the two other men goebel was considering as running mates would stack the senate committees against him . beckham was not yet , the minimum age to serve as governor , at the time of his selection . goebel lost a close election to republican william s. taylor . when the general assembly s session opened on january , , the election results were immediately challenged . with democrats in control of both houses of the assembly , the results seemed sure to be reversed . the assembly was still deliberating on january , , when goebel was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building . the following day , as goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel , the general assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election . he was sworn into office from his bed the same day . three days later goebel died , never having risen from the bed . legislative chaos ensued as taylor refused to acknowledge the assembly s decision and vacate the governorship . the republicans in the legislature obeyed taylor s orders , while the democrats ignored taylor and followed the orders of their leadership . finally , on february , , taylor and beckham agreed to let the courts settle the matter . the case first went before the louisville circuit court , which found in favor of beckham . republicans appealed to the kentucky court of appeals , at that time the court of last resort in the state . on april , , the court of appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court . taylor appealed to the supreme court of the united states , which declined to hear the case on may , . taylor s only supporter on the court was kentuckian john marshall harlan . following the supreme court ruling , taylor fled to indianapolis , indiana , fearing he would be implicated in goebel s assassination . beckham became acting governor , but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election , a special election was held november , , to determine who would complete goebel s unexpired term . beckham now of age won the election over republican john w. yerkes by fewer than , votes . shortly following the special election , beckham married jean raphael fuqua of owensboro . the couple had two sons . as governor beckham sought to unite his party and the state . as part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan goebel election law , authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the general assembly . he stressed non controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state s educational system . he recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices , a reform both he and goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign . however , his passive leadership ensured that the general assembly did little to address his agenda . the only major pieces of legislation passed during beckham s term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state s revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under to work without their parents consent . second term although the kentucky constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms , beckham announced he would seek a full term as governor in . his candidacy was challenged in court , but the court ruled beckham had not served a full first term and was eligible to run . due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non controversial reforms , he had no significant opposition in winning his party s nomination . his record also deprived his republican opponent , morris b. belknap , of any significant campaign issue in the general election . beckham defeated belknap and three minor candidates . in his message to the legislature in , beckham again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law , which had not passed during his first term . the law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the session . during the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late governor goebel . in march , beckham signed the day law mandating racial segregation of all schools in kentucky . berea college , a private college in eastern kentucky that had been integrated since the s , immediately filed suit to challenge the law . the substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the kentucky court of appeals . berea appealed to the supreme court , and in the court handed down an decision against the college . only john marshall harlan dissented . near the close of the session , legislators approved the creation of beckham county from parts of carter , elliott , and lewis counties . olive hill was made the county seat . soon the county s existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the square miles , km required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than square miles , km . carter county joined the lawsuit , claiming the border of beckham county passed too close to grayson , the seat of carter county , and vanceburg , the seat of lewis county . the state constitution forbade county borders to pass within miles km of a county seat . on april , , the kentucky court of appeals found in favor of the plaintiffs and dissolved beckham county . during the legislative session , beckham urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies , following the lead of new york attorney charles evans hughes . in particular , he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends , which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on hand for illegal purposes . he further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in kentucky , bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud . beckham refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing black patch tobacco wars . he cited constitutional reasons for his refusal , but more probably his reasons were political the democrats were dominant in this region and he didn t want to challenge his own party . by collecting some old civil war debts from the federal government , beckham virtually eliminated the state s debt . encouraged by the state s improved finances , the general assembly voted to expand two of the state s normal schools , western state teachers college in bowling green later western kentucky university and eastern state teachers college in richmond later part of eastern kentucky university . with a successful legislative session behind him , beckham made a bold political move in june he orchestrated an effort to set the democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in november a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election . beckham wanted the senate seat , and moving the primary up two years would allow him to secure his party s nomination while he was still governor . it also allowed him to use his influence as governor to sway the party s choice of his potential successor as governor . state auditor samuel wilbur hager was beckham s choice for governor and easily won the early primary over challenger n.b. hays . former governor james b. mccreary challenged beckham for the senatorial nomination , but beckham won by more than , votes . u.s. senator beckham s term as governor ended december , . in january he faced the legislature as the democratic nominee for a seat in the u.s. senate by virtue of the primary held two years earlier . the republicans nominated former governor william o. bradley . on the first ballot beckham secured of the needed votes bradley received votes . seven democrats had not voted for beckham . over the next six weeks , more votes were taken with neither man securing a majority , even though william jennings bryan , the democratic nominee for president , campaigned for beckham . some democrats pressured beckham to withdraw and allow a more palatable democrat to run , but he refused . on the th ballot , taken near the end of february , bradley finally secured a majority after four democrats crossed party lines to vote for him . beckham s ardent support of prohibition likely cost him the election . his position put him at odds with henry watterson , editor of the powerful louisville courier journal . as governor beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in louisville . when the kentucky court of appeals invalidated the results of louisville s municipal elections due to interference by the city s whiskey ring in may , beckham appointed robert worth bingham , a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist , as interim mayor until elections could be held in november . bingham eliminated grafting in the police department , closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on sunday . following this , the whiskey ring announced beckham had forfeited the support of louisville s legislators . in the senatorial election in , three of the four democrats who voted against beckham were from louisville . following his defeat , beckham returned to his law practice . six years later beckham again attempted to win the senate seat . due to the passage of the seventeenth amendment , the senator would not be elected by the legislature , but by popular vote . in the democratic primary beckham defeated augustus o. stanley , a year veteran congressman . the republican nominee was former governor augustus e. willson . bolstered by his support of president woodrow wilson , beckham won the election by , votes . beckham served as chairman of the senate committee on expenditures in the department of labor from to and on the senate committee on military affairs . in the latter position he was influential in securing two large military training posts for kentucky , camp zachary taylor and fort knox . though camp zachary taylor was abandoned after world war i , fort knox became the home of the united states bullion depository . when the united states entered world war i , beckham continued to back president wilson and supported the league of nations . true to his prohibitionist stance , beckham supported passage of the eighteenth amendment forbidding the import and sale of alcohol in the united states . the amendment was ratified and became effective in january . believing women should be protected from involvement in politics , beckham opposed the nineteenth amendment , which granted women s suffrage . the amendment failed on february , , but passed on june , . beckham voted against it both times . the democrats renominated beckham without opposition in . his opponent in the general election was republican richard p. ernst . prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state , and in areas where these industries were prominent beckham received more than , fewer votes than democratic presidential nominee james m. cox . he was also hurt by the women s vote and by his support of president wilson , who had lost popularity since beckham s election in . ernst won the election by fewer than , votes , winning the race with . percent of the vote to beckham s . percent . during his single term in the senate beckham served alongside three other u.s. senators from kentucky ollie m. james , george b. martin and augustus o. stanley . later life and death following his term in the senate , beckham resumed his legal practice in louisville . he sought another term as governor in . this time he had the support of the louisville courier journal , which had been purchased by his ally , robert w. bingham . he was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the jockey club , whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state s horse racetracks . the jockey club ran a candidate in both parties primary elections . in the democratic primary beckham defeated the club s relatively obscure candidate , robert t. crowe . flem d. sampson , the club s nominee in the republican primary , won his party s nomination . in the general election beckham could not secure the support of democratic governor william j. fields , who had been elected with the help of the jockey club . despite the democrats winning every other contest on the ballot , including the race for lieutenant governor , beckham lost to sampson by more than , votes . it was estimated that the club spent over , to defeat him . beckham was expected to be the democrats nominee for governor in , but the death of his son in late left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign . the democrats turned to a. b. happy chandler of henderson , who won the election . beckham supported chandler s bid , and in return chandler appointed him to the kentucky public service commission in . beckham also served on the department of business regulations commission and chaired the state government reorganization commission . beckham attempted to return to the senate in . the head of the jockey club , james b. brown , had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in . in beckham s ally , robert bingham , had been appointed ambassador to the court of st. james s , increasing his prominence and influence . beckham also enjoyed the support of the united mine workers and louisville mayor neville miller . the race was complicated , though , by the entry of john y. brown , a democrat who was a u.s. representative and former speaker of the kentucky house of representatives . he had agreed to support chandler s bid for the governorship in exchange for chandler s support in his run for the senate . however , chandler threw his support to beckham , and while brown was not able to win the seat without the support of bingham and chandler , he did garner , votes , most of them at beckham s expense . democratic incumbent m. m. logan retained the seat by , votes . beckham died in louisville on january , , and was buried in frankfort cemetery in frankfort , kentucky . beckham county , oklahoma , was named in his honor at the suggestion of a kentuckian who was serving as a delegate to oklahoma s constitutional convention in . wickland , his birthplace , was added to the national register of historic places on february , . new zealand native football team the new zealand native football team was a new zealand rugby union team that toured britain , ireland , australia and new zealand in and . it mostly comprised players of mori ancestry , and also included some pkeh white new zealanders . a wholly private endeavour , the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority it was organised by new zealand international player joseph warbrick , promoted by civil servant thomas eyton , and managed by james scott , a publican . the natives were the first new zealand team to perform a haka , and also the first to wear all black . they played rugby matches during the tour , as well as a small number of victorian rules football and association football matches in australia . having made a significant impact on the development of new zealand rugby , the natives were inducted into the international rugby board hall of fame in . after a preliminary tour of new zealand in , the side travelled to england via melbourne and suez . the mori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race , but the british press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as mori as they had expected . playing their first match , on october against surrey , the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule , and frequently played three matches per week . their early matches included a loss to middlesex , but their form improved in november , when they won of their matches . the team played its first international match on december , against ireland , and won . this was followed by a win over one of the strongest english county teams , yorkshire , and a defeat against the wales national team . by january the natives had played matches in less than three months , winning of them they had spent most of their time in the north of england , where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable . in a return match on january , yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the natives heaviest losses , a defeat . the team then went undefeated until february , when they faced england . officials of the strictly amateur rugby football union rfu had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the new zealanders , regarding them as unsportsmanlike , and tensions reached a nadir in the aftermath of the england international , during which the rfu secretary george rowland hill , refereeing the game , awarded a number of controversial tries to england , prompting three of the natives to temporarily leave the field in protest england eventually won . the natives apologised afterwards for their behaviour , but the damage was not repaired . the new zealanders left england without an official send off , and travelled to australia where they toured victoria , new south wales and queensland . they then returned to new zealand , where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before . they went games undefeated before losing their final match , on august , to auckland . the natives final record in rugby matches was wins , draws and losses . they introduced a number of tactical innovations to new zealand rugby on their return home , and their tour contributed to the formation of the new zealand rugby football union in . seventeen of the team s players went on to play provincially in new zealand , and two , thomas ellison and david gage , subsequently captained the new zealand national rugby team . background the idea for assembling a team of mori footballers to tour britain was conceived by joseph warbrick , a rugby player who had toured with the first new zealand national team in . he initially proposed a team of mori or part mori to play the touring british side in this developed into a venture to have a mori team tour britain if a preliminary tour of new zealand were successful . hearing of warbrick s plans , civil servant thomas eyton contacted him to offer help managing the tour , which warbrick accepted . when james scott , a publican , subsequently joined the partnership , the three men decided that warbrick would be the team s captain , scott its manager and eyton its promoter . warbrick started assembling a team for the tour in early . he had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability , and failed to secure the talented jack taiaroa due to his university commitments . some mori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part mori . twenty mori or part mori players joined the squad five pkeh white new zealand players were added after the team lost to auckland . due to the inclusion of these pkeh players the team was renamed from the new zealand maori to the new zealand native football representatives . the final squad comprised players including warbrick of these at least five were full blooded mori , while fourteen had a mori mother and a pkeh father . the parentage of some of the players is unknown . the team toured new zealand before departing overseas , playing against hawke s bay , auckland , nelson , wellington , canterbury , south canterbury , and otago . the first game was contested against hawke s bay in napier on june . they played nine games in their preliminary tour of new zealand , and won seven of them . their last new zealand match before departure , against otago played in dunedin on july , was won by one try to nil . the team sailed for australia from dunedin , leaving on august . in melbourne , scott recruited jack lawlor to train the players in victorian rules football in britain as preparation for possible victorian rules matches on their return to australia . the team played two rugby matches against the melbourne rugby union team , winning the first and drawing the second , before continuing to britain via suez . they arrived in london on september . arrival in england and early matches the team were met in britain by local rugby administrators , including an official of england s rugby football union rfu . the first match of the tour was against surrey , where the team became the first new zealand side to perform a haka , and also the first to wear an all black uniform . that the team was predominantly mori provoked curiosity from the british press at the time , most britons had not seen non white people but there was some surprise that the team were not as mori as had been expected . they are not unlike europeans , a scottish reporter wrote in november that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation . the surrey match , which was refereed by the rfu secretary george rowland hill , was won by the natives after they scored two tries . the natives next defeated both northamptonshire and kent , before defeats by moseley and burton on trent . both defeats were unexpected , and in the moseley match , injuries played a part the tourists played most of the match at least two men down , as replacements were then not allowed . the team recovered to win their next game , against midlands counties in birmingham . their next fixture was against middlesex in a match not open to the public , and hosted by the earl of sheffield at sheffield park , uckfield . the middlesex side contained a number of international players , including arthur gould . middlesex won easily , with the natives play characterised by poor tackling . the final score was , with three tries conceded by the new zealanders . prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine an indulgence the natives were not used to . a report in the auckland star had this to say of the game the new zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition of scratch players , whereas mr rowland hill had carefully collected the best possible team available . such passing as the home men displayed the maoris frankly admit they have never previously witnessed . said mccausland whilst we were on the platform waiting for the london train , i think they would have just beaten us , even if we had been in good form . following the match against middlesex , the team travelled to the north , where the strongest english rugby teams were based . yorkshire and lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the rfu in over the issue of broken time payments . the new zealanders lost to hull , defeated dewsbury , then lost to wakefield . after their first draw of the tour against northumberland county they defeated stockton on tees and tynemouth . joe warbrick appeared in the match against tynemouth , but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point . these victories were followed by a defeat to halifax on november . the team then won seven matches in a row , including one against hawick rfc , their only scottish opposition of the tour . the last two matches that month were a loss to swinton and a victory over liverpool and district . the team had played thirteen fixtures during november and won ten of them . by this point , the team was beset by injuries of the fifteen players that played against westmorland county on november , five had injuries . the squad comprised only players , and the tourists were often struggling to field a side . nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued on november they left for dublin , where a match had been organised against the ireland national team . ireland , further english matches , and wales the ireland fixture was played at lansdowne road , dublin , on december . both teams had a number of leading players out injured the irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection . ireland led at half time after scoring a converted try , but the natives improved considerably in the second half , scoring four tries . patrick keogh scored the first two tries , and his play was praised by the local press . the third try scored was by thomas ellison after a counter attack by george williams . the try was not converted , but the strong finish from the new zealanders gave the visitors a victory . the irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but ireland did go on to defeat wales two tries to nil in the home nations championship . following their defeat of ireland , the natives played trinity college and then north of ireland . the match against trinity college was drawn , and despite keogh not playing , the native side played much better than their previous fixture . the team then travelled to belfast , where they defeated north of ireland on december scoring two tries to nil . after returning to england , the natives faced lancashire in manchester , where they lost . two days later they drew with batley bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring five tries . their next match was against yorkshire , who were one of the strongest counties in the country , and went on to win the inaugural county championship that season . yorkshire fielded a weakened team , and were subsequently defeated by the natives , who scored six tries . after a further two victories , the team travelled to wales , where they lost to llanelli , before facing wales on december . at the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the welsh team due to fans of both swansea and llanelli feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players . four teams dominated welsh international selection at the time , and out of the man team only william towers and william bowen of swansea and dan griffiths of llanelli had been selected . the match was played in swansea , and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with gate receipts of only recorded . the crowd s hostility impacted on the players , and debutant norman biggs was palpably nervous at the start of the match . biggs , aged years and days , became the youngest welsh international player a record he held until the debut of tom prydie in . despite the heckles aimed primarily at biggs , charlie arthur and george thomas , the welsh team produced an excellent effort , especially from the forwards . towers scored the first welsh try , which was converted by jim webb . the natives replied with a spirited run by ellison , but he failed to break through the welsh defence . the tourists trailed even further after george thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half way line , which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd . webb , playing in out of position at full back , missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark . the natives continued to push , with elliot coming within five yards of the try line , and when ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the yard line before he could touch down . in the second half wales continued to push their advantage when alexander bland dribbled the ball into the natives this was collected by sydney nicholls , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing jim hannan to score . warbrick for the natives and stadden for wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further scores in the game . the match was also of historical importance because of the welsh tactics employed . in the home nations championship wales had trialled the four three quarter system , wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine , and instead employ an extra centre three quarter . the system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star welsh player arthur gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team newport to retain the additional forward . with gould working in the west indies , wales again tried the four three quarter system against the natives , and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system . within six years the other three home countries had adopted four three quarter style of play . before they left wales , the natives played swansea and two other local clubs , newport , and cardiff . they defeated swansea for their first win in wales , and followed this up with a victory over newport in front of , spectators . they finished their welsh matches , and the year , with a loss to cardiff in front of a partisan crowd . return to england the side entered having played matches for wins and three draws . the natives play had improved throughout november and december following poorer form in their october matches positive press reports reflected this improvement . the team would go on to play a further matches before their february international against england . january started with a loss to bradford , during which police officers were required to keep many of the , spectators , many of them non paying , in order . this was followed by victories over leeds parish church , kirkstall , brighouse rangers , and huddersfield . following further matches against stockport , castleford , and warrington , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced yorkshire for a second time . yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line up against the natives when the sides first met in december . after the unexpected loss , yorkshire were determined to make amends and a strong side was selected for the county , including fred bonsor , richard lockwood and john willie sutcliffe , all of whom would appear for england against the natives later that season . described as knocked about and stale , the natives struggled to compete against such strong opposition , and yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to ellison left the scores at at half time . the second half was little better for the natives they conceded a further two tries as well as a drop goal . the second of these tries was scored by lockwood after he ran the ball from his own half . ellison scored a converted try late in the match , but this didn t prevent the natives suffering their largest defeat of the tour to the yorkshiremen . ellison later described the match as without a murmur , the biggest beating we received in our whole tour . after a victory over spen valley district , the team travelled west to play somersetshire , devonshire , taunton , and gloucestershire , and won all five games . the victory over somerset was the new zealanders largest of the tour they scored nine tries in a victory . half back keogh played outstandingly for the natives , while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition . devonshire and tauton suffered heavy defeats by the new zealanders , before a strong gloucestershire side was dismissed . after defeating midland counties , the natives returned to london . the team had two further matches before their international against england . the first was against one of the strongest clubs in england , blackheath . andrew stoddart , who had toured new zealand and australia with the british isles side , played for the club in their defeat to the natives . the new zealanders won having scored four tries , including two by keogh . their next opposition was a united services side mainly comprising royal navy players . the natives were again victorious , this time . the match against oxford university was postponed due to heavy frost , and so the team had a seven day break from playing their longest of the tour . england international the match against england was causing the natives players and management problems before it had even begun . the team manager , scott , was in dispute with the rfu over where the match should be played the rfu were adamant that the match should take place at blackheath s ground , but scott wanted the game to proceed at the oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured . the strictly amateur rfu establishment were already suspicious of the profit making motives of the natives , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue . the rfu was also in dispute with the other home unions over the formation of the international rugby football board irfb . following a disputed try in an england scotland international match in , the scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game , but the rfu insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote , arguing that they deserved this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs . ireland , wales and scotland consequently refused to play against england until , when , following arbitration , the rfu relented and joined the irfb . the absence of international matches was a factor in england agreeing to face the natives on february . the line ups selected for the february match were both strong , and close to full strength . though of the england side had not played internationally before , all were experienced at domestic level . the match was refereed by rowland hill , who had also officiated the natives first match in britain , against surrey . the opening of the first half was a scoreless affair , with much tackling and scrummaging on the heavy ground . later in the half england scored two tries through harry bedford , but both were disputed by the natives , who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in goal . england took the two try advantage into the second half . early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the english . the try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the natives and the rfu . ellison attempted to tackle the english player stoddart , and in the process ripped his shorts off . the natives quickly formed a circle around stoddart to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen . while this was happening one of the english players , frank evershed , picked up the ball and scored a try . the new zealanders protested , believing that play had stopped after claiming stoddart had called dead ball but hill awarded the try , prompting three of the native players , dick taiaroa , williams , and sherry wynyard , to leave the field in protest . the aggrieved players were eventually persuaded to return , but not before hill had restarted play . ellison was very critical of hill , particularly because he was also secretary of the rfu . ellison wrote after the tour that gross as these errors were , they were insignificant when compared with another that mr hill committed at the outset of the game , viz , refereeing at all in that game . the disputed try was followed by a final try for the english , who ultimately won . the rfu , at hill s instigation , promptly demanded an apology from the natives captain of the day , edward mccausland , who had led the team as joe warbrick was injured . the english authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question , and that protesting a decision as the new zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike . the rfu threatened to bar any of their affiliated players in other words , the entire rugby playing population of england from facing the natives if they did not apologise . mccausland swiftly sent an apology by telegram , but this was deemed inadequate he therefore sent another , four days after the game the london establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the new zealanders approach to the game reports of rough and over aggressive play by the natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in britain . in the north of england , criticism of the visitors sportsmanship was rarer the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south . some of the natives , including joe warbrick , accused the rfu and the english press of hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to criticise the new zealanders for rough play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players . later matches and departure from england the natives remained in london following the england international . they defeated london welsh on february , before losing first to cambridge , then oxford university . from there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to leigh . after a win over runcorn , there was a defeat to oldham , played on a ground eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous . after reversing their previous loss to halifax with a win , the natives suffered a loss to barrow and district on march . the new zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a draw with hull . widnes were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists last match in northern england . the team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in britain . they eventually played southern counties , and beat them . this was their th match in the british isles and their th victory . the authorities and press in london continued to view the team negatively , and the natives boarded ship without a formal farewell . this perceived affront from the rfu provoked some criticism from the press outside london , as well as from the team manager scott , who felt that with the team s official apology after the england match , the controversy should have put to rest . australia the majority of the natives left plymouth on march eyton and pie wynyard followed a week later . they arrived in melbourne in may , where the team played mostly victorian rules football , hoping to make more money that way . although the side had employed jack lawlor to coach them in victorian rules during their tour of the british isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training . as a result , the victorian rules matches were a failure the players unfamiliarity with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the natives were rugby forwards and therefore less suited to the more open victorian rules , ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds . the side played nine victorian rules matches in total , including one in new south wales , but won only three of them , all against relatively weak opposition . the side s success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in victorian rules the new zealanders played three rugby matches while in victoria against melbourne , a navy selection , and victoria . the matches were all won , with their game against victoria a victory . after this they left for sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated new south wales . after two further victories , the side again faced new south wales , and won the match . another two victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches of the tour both defeats . the team travelled north to queensland , where , as in new south wales , rugby was the dominant code of football . consequently , the team exclusively played rugby while in the region . the natives faced queensland at the association ground in brisbane . the spectators witnessed the new zealanders overwhelm the queenslanders to win the natives did not exert themselves in the win , and the score did not reflect their dominance . after a further two matches , against toowoomba and ipswich both of whom were comfortably defeated , the team returned to brisbane for a rematch with queensland . in contrast to their first meeting , the first half was a close affair , and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half . billy warbrick suffered a kick to the head , and had to retire early in the second half . following the loss of warbrick , the play of the natives improved and they recovered to win . not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered by bookmakers to throw the game . eyton later said it was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought , in racing parlance , to be playing stiff , and that they had been got by some bookies at all events , when accused of it at half time and cautioned , they played a different game in the second half . the response from the team s management was to suspend four players . the team travelled to toowoomba , where they defeated the locals . the natives included a replacement player for only the second time , charles speakman , after the suspensions reduced the playing strength of the side . the team then travelled back to new zealand , and arrived in invercargill on august . return to new zealand two days after their return , the natives faced southland , who they defeated in front of a crowd of , . the side suffered further injury , to harry lee , and recruited southlander w. hirst for their match against mataura district on august . despite playing the match two players down , the natives comfortably defeated mataura . following the side s return to new zealand , the otago rugby football union demanded that the team s management explain the accusations levelled at them in queensland . eyton responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred . the northern rugby union since renamed queensland rugby union summarised the incident and aftermath in the queensland rugby union annual ... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the maori , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination . four members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match . the matter was bought before the otago union , who passed the following resolution that , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the native team , and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management , we are of opinion that there are no facts before us justifying the allegations ... it is unlikely , given the attitude of the otago rugby union to the natives before their departure , that they would have dismissed the allegations if incriminating evidence had existed . the side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced otago in dunedin . the natives outscored their opponents five tries to two , and won . the side s star player and half back , keogh , stayed in dunedin when the team departed for christchurch . the side faced hawke s bay , who were touring , in christchurch , and handily defeated them . the natives play was praised by the press ... the wearers of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and quickness between their legs , over their shoulders , under their arms and with their feet . the side then faced canterbury on august , who they thrashed . the report published in the press said of the natives performance the play showed on saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do ... it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men . in the loose , in the scrum , dribbling , passing , collaring , or running they were very much indeed canterbury s superior . such runs as were made by warbrick at full back , by madigan , gage , and w. wynyard , the passing of h. wynyard , f. warbrick , and all the backs as well as several forwards , the rushes of alf warbrick , maynard , taare , taiaroa , and rene , and the dodging and fending powers of nearly every one , nonplussed their opponents ... the side left christchurch and travelled north where they played wairarapa in masterton . the match was won , and the next day they faced wellington , who they also defeated . the fixture against wellington was nearly abandoned because scott and the wellington rugby union could not agree on a venue the match went ahead only when the wellington officials agreed to cede the natives all profit from the match . after this the natives travelled to auckland where they played their last match , against the province on august . the match was lost after each team scored two tries each , but the aucklanders kicked a drop goal and a conversion . the loss ended a remarkable run of matches the natives had a game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over widnes on march the side won , and drew one match between the defeats . impact and legacy the tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within new zealand . it was the first tour of the british isles by a team from the southern hemisphere , and the longest in the history of the sport . by the time the natives returned to new zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any in the country , and introduced a number of tactical innovations . seventeen of the players went on to play provincially in new zealand , and two , ellison and david gage , subsequently captained new zealand . the tour also prompted the eventual formation of the new zealand rugby football union nzrfu , later renamed new zealand rugby union in one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring new zealand sides . the nzrfu sent an officially sanctioned new zealand team , captained by ellison , to tour australia in . the natives are also the forefathers of the mori all blacks , a representative team organised by the nzrfu , that first played in . the native team , along with joe warbrick , was inducted into the irb hall of fame in the seventh inductee . squad the squad consisted of players . the exact names of several of the players is unknown .

mezzo soprano and voice teacher . she performed and popularised songs by contemporary composers throughout her career and sang in the american premieres of several works by erik satie , maurice ravel and igor stravinsky , including the title role in the latter s persphone . the niece of lady laurier and sir wilfrid laurier , who also were her patrons , she initially trained and performed in europe . she then travelled to java and for four years immersed herself in its native music , which she introduced to north american audiences on her return . she retired from performing in , and opened a voice studio in new york , where she became a founding member of the american guild of musical artists and served on its board of governors . gauthier was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music . the citation from the campion society of san francisco , which she received in , said ... her rare open mindedness and unorthodox enthusiasm having been initially responsible for the recognition of many vital and important modern composers singing career born in ottawa , ontario , gauthier received musical lessons as a child , in harmony , voice , and piano . the custom of the time dictated that north american musicians travel to europe for training if they desired a reputable professional career , and in july , at the age of seventeen , gauthier set out for europe , financed by her aunt and uncle , lady zo laurier and sir wilfrid laurier . training in europe gauthier travelled to france , where she received private voice lessons from auguste jean dubulle of the paris conservatory . nodules on her vocal cords were problematic , but they were removed surgically . she later began training under jacques bouhy , whom she would later credit for her vocal technique . in , gauthier was retained by fellow canadian singer emma albani to accompany her on a tour of england and her canadian farewell tour . albani provided a degree of mentorship to gauthier during the week tour of canada . lord strathcona awarded gauthier a scholarship in that allowed her to return to europe and continue her vocal studies . she returned there and continued both to study and give performances . her first operatic performance came in in pavia , italy as micala in bizet s carmen . she landed a second operatic role as mallika in delibes lakm , which was being performed by the london covent garden opera company . the opera opened in june . supposedly , luisa tetrazzini , the prima donna soprano of the company , feared that gauthier s voice would outshine her own , and demanded that gauthier be removed from the opera . the company s director acquiesced to tetrazzini s demands , informing gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing . gauthier reacted badly , and quit opera entirely . move to java disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene , gauthier departed europe and travelled to java . there , she met a dutch importer and plantation manager named frans knoote . gauthier and knoote married on may , . gauthier studied the music of java , and began to include this in her repertoire . her accompanying pianist was paul seelig , who had previously been the conductor for the kraton of surakarta , which afforded gauthier a number of opportunities . on permission of the javanese court , she studied the gamelan , probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity . while living in java , gauthier travelled extensively , giving performances in china , japan , singapore , malaya , australia , and new zealand . she remained in java for four years , but with the outbreak of world war i she decided to travel back to north america , arriving in new york city in the fall of . return to north america arriving in new york , gauthier struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene . she put on a performance in vaudeville entitled songmotion , which combined javan music with dancers . new york was already home to many north american and european musical performers , so gauthier focused on her javan musical repertoire , which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing . gauthier began giving annual recitals at aeolian hall , and in november her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers . she developed her own reputation quickly , known as a ... sensitive purveyor of interesting , untried songs . she gave renditions of three songs by maurice ravel . her performance then also included american premieres of stravinsky s three japanese lyrics and griffes five poems of ancient china and japan . the performance was a great success , and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers . stravinsky arranged to have gauthier to premiere all of his vocal pieces . gauthier travelled to paris in at the behest of the music league of america . sent there to arrange a tour of north america by maurice ravel , she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him , but also with erik satie and les six . this led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert . she accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her , the only exception being a refusal to perform pierrot lunaire by arnold schoenberg . through this , gauthier performed large amounts of contemporary french music across the united states . she also included american music in all of her concerts . gauthier toured america frequently and returned to europe in , and again in . she began to explore jazz music in concert as well , earning her negative reviews by many musical critics . her annual performance at aeolian hall entitled recital of ancient and modern music for voice became a historic occasion when she presented the works of george gershwin , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert . the first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time . she performed both classical works by vincenzo bellini and henry purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by arnold schoenberg , darius milhaud , bla bartk , and paul hindemith . the second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . she opened with alexander s ragtime band by irving berlin , then performed works by jerome kern and walter donaldson , and finally finished with three works by george gershwin i ll build a stairway to paradise , innocent ingnue baby , and swanee . gershwin played the piano for these pieces . important figures in the audience included ernestine schumann heink , virgil thomson , and paul whiteman . although some musical critics panned her decision to include jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art . gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences . on some occasions , such as her performances of gershwin in new york in and , as well as in london in , this was quite successful . a critic in vienna welcomed her musical selection as a reprieve from the usual fare of classical performances schubert , brahms , wolf , richard strauss while praising her skill with more classical choices . other performances suffered she was booed while performing works by heitor villa lobos at the festival of the international society of contemporary music in venice . she became a celebrity , and continued giving performances across the united states , europe , and her native canada . on the sixtieth anniversary of canadian confederation in , she gave a performance in ottawa which was the first transcontinental radio broadcast in canada . although she toured canada from time to time , and attended performances of canadian music in new york , she held a negative opinion of canada s treatment of native musicians , saying canadians . . . would rather listen to foreigners than their own people . retirement from the stage illness forced gauthier to halt giving performances in the late s , but she would return to the stage in , giving a concert in havana , cuba . as time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching , and less and less in stage performing . her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring . she retired from performing entirely in , and opened a music studio in new york . there she became a founding member of the american guild of musical artists , serving on its board of governors . she died on december , . views of critics and audiences gauthier was a controversial musician in her time . her choice of music for performance was often condemned , and often praised . the appropriateness of jazz music for a classically trained singer , combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some critics to cheer her for promoting otherwise overlooked music , and others to condemn her for taking lowbrow music into a highbrow venue . a may , review by the new york times praised her natural talent , with some reservations about the unpolished quality of her voice . her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised ... her singing of songs by frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them . a november , time review of her performance of historic italian songs , as well as modern english , french , austrian , german and american numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music . the critic remarked her voice was much too good for jazz . here she was praised as a serious , scholarly artist whose performance was ... neat and expressive . the audience received the concert very enthusiastically . her performance in fargo in resulted in a headline in the fargo forum the next day that was headed eva gauthier s program sets whole town buzzing many people are of two minds regarding jazz numbers some reluctantly admit that they like them others keep silent or condemn them . the review divides the audience and critics into various camps those who openly enjoyed and applauded the performance those who openly disliked and condemned it those unsure how to react to a performance they liked but felt was inappropriate and those who liked the performance but would not show approval for fear of looking foolish or uncultured . archival materials va gauthier papers , music division , the new york public library . battle of sullivan s island the battle of sullivan s island or the battle of fort sullivan was fought on june , , during the american revolutionary war . it took place near charleston , south carolina , during the first british attempt to capture the city from american rebels . it is also sometimes referred to as the first siege of charleston , owing to a more successful british siege in . the british organized an expedition in early for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of north america . delayed by logistical concerns and bad weather , the expedition reached the coast of north carolina in may . finding conditions unsuitable for their operations , general henry clinton and admiral sir peter parker decided instead to act against charleston . arriving there in early june , troops were landed on long island , near sullivan s island where colonel william moultrie commanded a partially constructed fort , in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault . general charles lee , commanding the southern continental theater of the war , would provide supervision . the land assault was frustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to wade , and the american defenses prevented an amphibious landing . the naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the spongy nature of the fort s palmetto log construction . careful fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the british fleet , which withdrew after an entire day s bombardment . the british withdrew their expedition force to new york , and did not return to south carolina until . background when the american revolutionary war broke out in , the city of charleston in the colony of south carolina was a center of commerce in southern north america . the city s citizens joined other colonists in opposing the british parliament s attempts to tax them , and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the april battles of lexington and concord . throughout and into , militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony s backcountry , the city s manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel , and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city . british operations british army forces in north america were primarily tied up with the siege of boston in . seeking bases of operations where they had more control , the british planned an expedition to the southern colonies . major general henry clinton , then in boston , was to travel to cape fear , north carolina , where he would join with largely scottish loyalists raised in the north carolina backcountry , and a force of , men from ireland under the command of major general charles cornwallis . the plan was beset by difficulties from the start . the irish expedition , originally supposed to depart at the beginning of december , was delayed by logistical difficulties , and its , troops did not depart until february , , escorted by warships under the command of admiral sir peter parker . clinton left boston on january with two companies of light infantry , and first stopped at new york city to confer with william tryon , new york s royal governor . major general charles lee , sent by major general george washington to see to the defense of new york , coincidentally arrived there the same day as clinton . new york was at that time extremely tense patriot forces were beginning to disarm and evict loyalists , and the british fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions . despite this , clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south . lee observed that this was certainly a droll way of proceeding to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited . this was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists a letter intercepted in december had already provided intelligence that the british were planning to go to the south . clinton arrived at cape fear on march , expecting to find the european convoy already there . he met with the royal governors of north and south carolina , josiah martin and william campbell , and learned that the recruited scottish loyalists had been defeated at moore s creek bridge two weeks earlier . clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of georgia , james wright , who had been arrested , and then escaped to a navy ship . parker s fleet had an extremely difficult crossing . battered by storms and high seas , the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at cape fear until april , and cornwallis did not arrive until may . after several weeks there , in which the british troops raided patriot properties , clinton , cornwallis and parker concluded that cape fear was not a suitable base for further operations . parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions up and down the coast , and reports on the partially finished condition of the charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there . american defenses john rutledge , recently elected president of the general assembly that remained as the backbone of south carolina s revolutionary government , organized a defense force under the command of year old colonel william moultrie , a former militiaman and indian fighter . these forces comprised three infantry regiments , two rifle regiments , and a small artillery regiment they were augmented by three independent artillery companies , and the total force numbered about , . these forces were further augmented by the arrival of continental regiments from north carolina and virginia , troops , as well as militia numbering , from charleston and the surrounding backcountry . moultrie saw sullivan s island , a sandy spit of land at the entrance to charleston harbor extending north about miles . km long and a few hundred yards wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from intruding enemy warships . a large vessel sailing into charleston first had to cross charleston bar , a series of submerged shoals lying about miles km southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of sullivan s island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor . later it would also have to pass the northern end of james island , where fort johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city . moultrie and his nd south carolina regiment arrived on sullivan s island in march , and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into charleston harbor . the construction moved slowly captain peter horry of the patriot naval detachment described the site as an immense pen feet long , and feet wide , filled with sand to stop the shot . the gun platforms were made of planks two inches thick and fastened with wooden spikes . congress had appointed general lee to command the continental army troops in the southern colonies , and his movements by land shadowed those of clinton s fleet as it sailed south . lee wrote from wilmington on june that the fleet had sailed , but that he did not know whether it was sailing for virginia or south carolina . he headed for charleston , saying i confess i know not whether i shall go to or from the enemy . he arrived in charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor , and took command of the city s defenses . he immediately ran into a problem the south carolina troops militia or the colonial regiments were not on the continental line , and thus not formally under his authority . some south carolina troops resisted his instructions , and rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming lee in command of all south carolina forces . square shaped fort sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall , with walls made from palmetto logs feet . m high and feet . m wide . the walls were filled with sand , and rose feet . m above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted . a hastily erected palisade of thick planks helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls . an assortment of cannon , ranging from and pounders to a few british pounders and french pounders , dotted the front and rear walls . general lee , when he had seen its unfinished state , had recommended abandoning the fort , calling it a slaughter pen . president rutledge refused , and specifically ordered colonel moultrie to obey lee in everything , except in leaving fort sullivan . moultrie s delaying tactics so angered lee that he decided on june that he would replace moultrie the battle began the next day before he could do so . lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to haddrell s point . british arrival the british fleet weighed anchor at cape fear on may , and arrived outside charleston harbor the next day . moultrie noticed a british scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby long island now known as the isle of palms , just a few hundred yards from sullivan s island troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of sullivan s . by june , most of the british fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in five fathom hole , an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance . with the fort on sullivan s island only half complete , admiral parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls . optimistically believing he would not even need clinton s land forces , he wrote to clinton that after the fort s guns were knocked out , he would land seamen and marines which i have practiced for the purpose under the guns and that they could keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper . the british fleet was composed of nine man of war ships the flagship gun bristol , as well as the gun experiment and frigates actaeon , active , solebay , siren , sphinx , friendship and the bomb vessel thunder , in total mounting nearly cannon . the army forces in the expedition consisted of the th , th , rd , th , th , and th regiments of foot , and part of the th . on june , clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms . however , the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it which was flying a truce flag , and it was not delivered until the next day . that same day , clinton began landing , troops on long island . the intent was that these troops would wade across the channel now known as breach inlet between long and sullivan s , which the british believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so , while the fleet bombarded fort sullivan . general lee responded to the british landing with several actions . he began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the british were intending to launch an attack directly on charleston . he also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort s garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile . km channel separating the island from charleston the unwillingness of moultrie and rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role . the americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of sullivan s island , which was manned by more than men and three small cannons , and began to fortify a guard post at haddrell s point on the mainland opposite fort sullivan . general clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on june . an attempt to wade the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition . he considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the americans , with timely advice from general lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the long island position . as a result , the british and american forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range . clinton reported that this meant that admiral parker would have the glory of being defeated alone . the attack was originally planned for june , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted parker to call it off for several days . battle on the morning of june , fort sullivan was defended by colonel moultrie , commanding the nd south carolina regiment and a company of the th south carolina artillery , numbering men . at around am that morning , a british ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack . less than an hour later , nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort . thunder and friendship anchored about . miles . km from the fort while parker took active , bristol , experiment and solebay to a closer position about yards m from sullivan s island , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort . each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire . although many of thunder s shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect according to moultrie , we had a morass in the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried . thunder s role in the action was also relatively short lived she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the overloading of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts . owing to shortage of gunpowder , moultrie s men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons . they also fired in small volleys , four cannon at a time . one british observer wrote , their fire was surprisingly well served and it was slow , but decisive indeed they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed . general clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of sullivan s island . assisted by two sloops of war , the flotilla of longboats carrying his troops came under fire from colonel william thomson s defenses . facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire , clinton abandoned the attempt . around noon the frigates sphinx , syren , and actaeon were sent on a roundabout route , avoiding some shoals , to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort s main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort . however , all three ships grounded on an uncharted sandbar , and the riggings of actaeon and sphinx became entangled in the process . the british managed to refloat sphinx and syren , but acteon remained grounded , having moved too far onto the submerged sandbar . consequently , none of these ships reached its intended position , a piece of good fortune not lost on colonel moultrie had these three ships effected their purpose , they would have enfiladed us in such a manner , as to have driven us from our guns . at the fort , moultrie ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man of war ships , bristol and experiment , which took hit after hit from the fort s guns . chain shot fired at bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main and mizzenmasts . one round hit her quarterdeck , slightly wounding parker in the knee and thigh . the shot also tore off part of his britches , leaving his backside exposed . by mid afternoon , the defenders were running out of gunpowder , and their fire was briefly suspended . however , lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland , and the defenders resumed firing at the british ships lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day , telling colonel moultrie , i see you are doing very well here , you have no occasion for me , i will go up to the town again . admiral parker eventually sought to destroy the fort s walls with persistent broadside cannonades . this strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions the structure would quiver , and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering . the exchange continued until around pm , when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities , and the fleet finally withdrew out of range . at one point during the battle , the flag moultrie had designed and raised over the fort was shot down . sergeant william jasper reportedly ran to the battlement and raised the flag again , holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided . he was credited by moultrie with reviving the troops spirits , and later given commendations for bravery . a painting of this event pictured above depicts jasper s actions . counting casualties , parker reported sailors killed and wounded aboard bristol , which was hit more than times with much damage to the hull , yards , and rigging . experiment was also badly damaged with sailors killed and wounded . active and solebay reported casualties each . the americans reported their casualties at only killed and wounded . the following morning , the british , unable to drag the grounded acteon off the sandbar , set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands . patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ship , fired some of its cannons at the british ships , took what stores and loot they could , and retreated shortly before the ship s powder magazine exploded . aftermath the british did not attempt to take the fort again . within days of the battle , charlestonians learned of the signing of the declaration of independence in philadelphia . the british troops were reembarked on their transports , and on july the british fleet withdrew northward to help the main british army in its campaign against new york city . to add insult to injury , one of the british transports grounded off long island and was captured by patriot forces . the british did not return to charleston until , when general clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army . until the south again became a focus of the war in late , its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort . admiral parker and general clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle , each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition s failures . although clinton was not blamed by the government , popular opinion held him responsible , and parker was lauded for his personal bravery . legacy fort sullivan was renamed fort moultrie shortly after the battle to honor colonel william moultrie for his successful defense of the fort and the city of charleston . extensively modified in the years after the battle , it was supplanted by fort sumter as the principal defense of charleston prior to the outbreak of the american civil war . in , to celebrate the centennial , companies from savannah , augusta , macon , columbia , new york and boston were invited to charleston . the site was turned over to the national park service in , and is now part of fort sumter national monument . a small monument to the battle of sullivan s island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island , overlooking the inlet where general clinton s soldiers had hoped to cross . the monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement . one iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by colonel moultrie . commissioned by the colonial government , he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner , which was flown at the fort during the battle . despite being shot down during the siege , it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense and famously raised during victory . it came to be known as the moultrie flag or liberty flag . when charleston lost to the british in the siege was reclaimed by american forces at the end of the war , the flag was returned to the city by general nathanael greene . hu zhengyan hu zhengyan chinese c . was a chinese artist , printmaker and publisher . he worked in calligraphy , traditional chinese painting , and seal carving , but was primarily a publisher , producing academic texts as well as records of his own work . hu lived in nanjing during the transition from the ming dynasty to the qing dynasty . a ming loyalist , he was offered a position at the rump court of the hongguang emperor , but declined the post , and never held anything more than minor political office . he did , however , design the hongguang emperor s personal seal , and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor s capture and death in . he owned and operated an academic publishing house called the ten bamboo studio , in which he practised various multi colour printing and embossing techniques , and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise . hu s work at the ten bamboo studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking , leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form . hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled the ten bamboo studio manual of painting and calligraphy , an artist s primer which remained in print for around years . his studio also published seal catalogues , academic and medical texts , books on poetry , and decorative writing papers . many of these were edited and prefaced by hu and his brothers . biography hu was born in xiuning county , anhui province in or early . both his father and elder brother zhengxin , art name wusuo , were physicians , and after he turned he travelled with them while they practised medicine in the areas around lu an and huoshan . it is commonly stated that zhengyan himself was also a doctor , though the earliest sources attesting to this occur only in the second half of the th century . by , hu had moved to nanjing where he lived with his wife wu . their home on jilongshan , now also known as beiji ge , a hill located just within the northern city wall , served as a meeting house for like minded artists . hu named it the ten bamboo studio shizhuzhai , , after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property . it functioned as the headquarters for his printing business , where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers zhengxin and zhengxing , art name zizhu , and his sons qipu and qiyi , courtesy name . during hu s lifetime , the ming dynasty , which had ruled china for over years , was overthrown and replaced by china s last imperial dynasty , the qing . following the fall of the capital beijing in , remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a ming loyalist regime in nanjing with zhu yousong on the throne as the hongguang emperor . hu , who was noted for his seal carving and facility with seal script , created a seal for the new emperor . the court offered him the position of drafter for the secretariat zhongshu sheren , as a reward , but he did not accept the role although he did accord himself the title of zhongshu sheren in some of his subsequent personal seals . according to wen ruilin s lost history of the south nanjiang yishi , , prior to the qing invasion of nanjing hu studied at the national university there , and whilst a student was employed by the ministry of rites to record official proclamations he produced the imperial promotion of minor learning qin ban xiaoxue , and the record of displayed loyalty biaozhong ji , as part of this work . as a result , he was promoted to the ministry of personnel and gained admittance to the hanlin academy , but before he could take up this appointment , beijing had fallen to the manchu rebellion . since contemporaneous biographies wen s work was not published until make no mention of these events , it has been suggested that they were fabricated after hu s death . hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in , after the end of the ming dynasty . xiao yuncong and l liuliang recorded visiting him during his later years , in and respectively . he died in poverty at the age of , sometime around late or early . seal carving hu zhengyan was a noted seal carver , producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries . his style was rooted in the classical seal script of the han dynasty , and he followed the huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary he zhen . hu s calligraphy , although balanced and with a clear compositional structure , is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed . huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient , weathered impression , although unlike other huizhou artists hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals . hu s work was known outside his local area . zhou lianggong , a poet who lived in nanjing around the same time as hu and was a noted art connoisseur , stated in his biography of seal carvers yinren zhuan , that hu creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure , implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through nanjing . in , hu took it upon himself to create a new imperial seal for the hongguang emperor , which he carved after a period of fasting and prayer . he presented his creation with an essay , the great exhortation of the seal dabao zhen , , in which he bemoaned the loss of the chongzhen emperor s seal and begged heaven s favour in restoring it . hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming , equally footed couplets pianti , used in the imperial examinations , but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the southern ming court . ten bamboo studio despite his reputation as an artist and seal carver , hu was primarily a publisher . his publishing house , the ten bamboo studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and art medical textbooks books on etymology and phonetics and copies of as well as commentaries on the confucian classics . unlike other publishers in the area , the ten bamboo studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels . this bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio s location the mountain on which hu took up residence was just to the north of the nanjing guozijian national academy , which provided a captive market for academic texts . between and , the ten bamboo studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience . the studio s earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , tested prescriptions for myriad illnesses wanbing yanfang , was published in and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later . hu s brother zhengxin was a medical practitioner and appears to have been the author of these books . during the s the ten bamboo studio also produced political works extolling the rule of the ming these included the imperial ming record of loyalty huang ming biaozhong ji , , a biography of loyal ming officials , and the edicts of the imperial ming huang ming zhaozhi , , a list of imperial proclamations . after the fall of the ming dynasty , hu renamed the studio the hall rooted in the past digutang , as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty , although the ten bamboo imprint continued to be used . despite hu s withdrawal from society after , the studio continued to publish well into the qing dynasty , for the most part focussing on seal impression catalogues showcasing hu s carving work . the ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in china . at his studio , hu zhengyan experimented with various forms of woodblock printing , creating processes for producing multi coloured prints and embossed printed designs . as a result , he was able to produce some of china s first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as assorted block printing douban yinshua , . this system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour . it was a lengthy , painstaking process , requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image . hu also employed a related form of multiple block printing called set block printing taoban yinshua , , which had existed since the yuan period some years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again . he refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible . in some images , hu employed a blind embossing technique known as embossed designs gonghua , or embossed blocks gongban , , using an uninked , imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper . he used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants . this was a relatively new process , having been invented by hu s contemporary wu faxiang , who was also a nanjing based publisher . wu had used this technique for the first time in his book wisteria studio letter paper luoxuan biangu jianpu , , published in . both hu and wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers , the sale of which provided a sideline income for the ten bamboo studio . major works hu s most notable work is the ten bamboo studio manual of painting and calligraphy shizhuzhai shuhuapu , , an anthology of around prints by around thirty different artists including hu himself , published in . it consists of eight sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit . some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes . as well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic primer , with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy . although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to chinese painting . in this book , hu used his multiple block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps . the manual is bound in the butterfly binding hudie zhuang , style , whereby whole folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double page spread . this binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image . cambridge university library released a complete digital scan of the manual , including all writings and illustrations in august , . said charles aylmer , head of the cambridge university chinese department , the binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was digitized , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it despite its undoubted importance to scholars . this volume went on to influence colour printing across china , where it paved the way for the later but better known manual of the mustard seed garden jieziyuan huazhuan , and also in japan , where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in ukiyo e of the colour woodblock printing process known as nishiki e . the popularity of the ten bamboo studio manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late qing dynasty . hu also produced the work ten bamboo studio letter paper shizhuzhai jianpu , , a collection of paper samples , which made use of the gonghua stamped embossing technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief . whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers , it also contained paintings of rocks , people , ritual vessels and other subjects . the book was bound in the wrapped back baobei zhuang , style , in which the folio pages are folded , stacked , and sewn along the open edges . originally published in , it was reissued in four volumes between and by zheng zhenduo and lu xun , and revised and republished again in . other publications other works produced by hu s studio included a reprint of zhou boqi s manual of seal script calligraphy , the six styles of calligraphy , correct and erroneous liushu zheng e , and the related necessary investigations into calligraphy shufa bi ji , , which discussed common errors in the formation of characters . with his brother zhengxin , hu edited a new introductory edition of the confucian classics , entitled the standardised text of the four books , identified and corrected sishu dingben bianzheng , , giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text . a similar approach was taken with the essentials of the thousand character classic in six scripts qianwen liushu tongyao , , which hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher , li deng . it was published after li s death , partly in homage to him . the three hu brothers worked together to collate a student primer on poetry by their contemporary ye tingxiu , which was called simply the discussion of poetry shi tan , . other works on poetry from the studio included helpful principles to the subtle workings of selected tang poems leixuan tang shi zhudao weiji , , which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included colophons by hu zhengyan himself . among the studio s more obscure publications was a text on chinese dominoes entitled paitong fuyu , written under a pseudonym but with a preface by hu zhengyan . gallery images from the ten bamboo studio manual of painting and calligraphy raid on manila the raid on manila of january was a royal navy false flag military operation during the french revolutionary wars intended to scout the strength of the defences of manila , capital of the spanish philippines , capture a manila galleon and assess the condition of the spanish navy squadron maintained in the port . spain had transformed from an ally of great britain in the war of the first coalition into an enemy in . thus the presence of a powerful spanish squadron at manila posed a threat to the china fleet , an annual convoy of east indiaman merchant ships from macau in qing dynasty china to britain , which was of vital economic importance to britain . so severe was this threat that a major invasion of the spanish philippines had been planned from british india during , but had been called off following the treaty of campo formio in europe and the possibility of a major war in india between the british east india company and the kingdom of mysore . to ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at macau in the winter of , the british commander in the east indies , rear admiral peter rainier , sent a convoy to china escorted by the frigates hms sybille and hms fox and commanded by captain edward cooke . after completing his mission cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of spanish forces in manila himself . he was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from manila , which would make a valuable prize . sailing in sybille and accompanied by captain pulteney malcolm in fox , cooke reached the spanish capital on january . anchored in manila bay , cooke pretended that his ships were french vessels and successfully lured successive boatloads of spanish officials aboard , taking them prisoner in turn . once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in manila , that the treasure ship had been unloaded at cavite and that the spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations , he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the pasig river . capturing the gunboats in a bloodless attack , cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards , unsuccessfully assaulting zamboanga before returning to macau . background in , after three years of the french revolutionary wars , spain and the french republic signed the treaty of san ildefonso . the secret terms of this treaty required spain to renounce its alliance with great britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally . in the east indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant british forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the spanish philippines to the east . britain dominated the east indies in , controlling the trade routes through the indian ocean from the ports of bombay , madras and calcutta . dutch ceylon , the dutch cape colony and parts of the dutch east indies had been captured in , and the french presence in the region had been confined to le de france and a few subsidiary islands in the western indian ocean . some of the most important trade routes began at canton and macau in qing dynasty china . early in each year a large convoy known as the china fleet , composed of large east indiaman merchant ships in the employ of the british east india company , sailed westwards to europe from macau laden with tea and other commercial cargo . this convoy was economically significant to britain one convoy in was valued at over million the equivalent of , , as of . in january the convoy had been attacked by the french squadron in the east indies , comprising six frigates commanded by contre amiral pierre csar charles de sercey . in the ensuing bali strait incident the commander deceived sercey into believing that the unescorted convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the french admiral retreated , only learning of his error on his return to le de france . there was considerable concern in india that sercey might try again in , or that the spanish , who maintained a powerful squadron at cavite , might make an attempt of their own . rainier s initial impulse on learning in november of the impending declaration of war between britain and spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the philippines , centred on manila in repetition of the successful british capture of manila in . co operating with the governor general of india sir john shore and colonel arthur welleley among others , a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation which was in the advance planning stages , when unexpected news arrived in india in august announcing the treaty of campo formio which brought the war of the first coalition to an end . britain now faced france and spain alone , while emissaries from the tipu sultan of the kingdom of mysore , an old opponent of britain in southern india , were seeking french assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities . the resources planned for the operation against manila were therefore retained in india and the operation cancelled , but the protection of the china fleet was still essential and rainier diverted some of his squadron eastwards to china . a number of merchant ships had gathered at bombay in the spring of in preparation for the trip to macau to load trade goods and join the china fleet . to escort this force , rainier provided the gun frigate hms sybille , captured from the french at the battle of mykonos in , and the gun hms centurion , which sailed with the convoy in july , taking passage through the straits of malacca , joined there by the ships of the line hms victorious and hms trident and the gun frigate hms fox under captain pulteney malcolm for the final voyage to macau . the convoy arrived without incident on december , although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses . cooke s raids reconnaissance of manilla with his convoy safely at anchor in macau and the china fleet several weeks from sailing , cooke decided to reconnoitre manila and make observations on the port and the spanish squadron based there . as an added motivation , rumours in macau suggested that the annual manila galleon was due to arrive . this ship brought up to two million spanish silver dollars from acapulco across the pacific ocean stopping at guam on its way to manila . depositing its dollars in the philippines , the ship then loaded trade goods from the east indies for the return journey to new spain . this round trip was essential to the maintenance of the spanish empire in the east indies , which operated at an enormous financial loss only mitigated by the substantial subsidy from new spain . spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the east indies , and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade but british sailors had nevertheless been attacking the manila galleons since thomas cavendish in . leaving the heavier warships at macau , cooke sailed on january only with sybille and fox , the latter carrying a mr. bernard , an experienced linguist . passing luzon , cooke s ships encountered a small spanish merchant vessel , which was lured towards the frigates , which were flying french tricolors . seizing the spanish vessel , cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the spanish squadron in manila were undergoing extensive repairs at cavite and were unfit to sail . cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact , although he did remove , silver dollars . the spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in april and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time cooke s small squadron arrived off manila . cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as french vessels , modelling sybille on the powerful gun forte and fox on the smaller prudente . dinner on sybille late in the afternoon of january , sybille and fox arrived in manila bay , slipping unchallenged past the fortress of corregidor and then sailing across the bay on the morning of january , anchoring between manila and cavite . from his vantage point cooke could see the spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in cavite , the ships of the line san pedro , europa and montas and the frigates maria de la cabeya and luisa in dock and unfit for action . to cooke s disappointment he could also see the manila galleon , marquesetta being unloaded at the cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship rey carlos aground in the harbour . the spanish had learned only shortly before cooke s arrival that the british frigate hms resistance under captain edward pakenham was in philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack . fox was the first british ship into the anchorage , and was consequently approached by the guardboat , whose crew came aboard . malcolm , like cooke , spoke french fluently and with bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new arrivals were forte and prudente seeking supplies and spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations . the officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the spanish ships would be in a position to sail until march at the earliest . cooke then joined the party on the deck of fox , claiming to be commodore latour , a french officer who , unknown to the spanish , had been killed in the action of september off sumatra . the spanish officer was now completely convinced by the ruse , which had been augmented by fake french uniforms . inviting the visitor below decks , cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of toasts , including the downfall of england . for an hour the officers drank , malcolm and cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the philippines , until a second boat pulled alongside fox containing more officers keen to greet the french arrivals . this vessel was the personal barge of the spanish commander at cavite , rear admiral don ignacio mara de lava , who was not aboard , but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat . each time , the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at gunpoint and taken below decks as prisoners of war . in malcolm s cabin , the captured officers were informed of their situation , promised release before the british frigates sailed , and offered more wine . the crew of fox meanwhile forced the captured spanish sailors to strip and donned their clothing . climbing into the spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby pasig river , where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored . taking the crews by surprise , the british boarding parties drove off the spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside fox . these vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well armed , one with a pounder long gun and two with pounder long guns , each supplemented by four swivel guns . the harbour captain reached fox shortly afterwards , furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned . malcolm received him with a tirade of near incomprehensible french and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin , while the boat s crew were imprisoned below decks . shortly afterwards , at , cooke and malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and grog to the crew , the total number of spanish sailors on fox now numbering approximately . once the meal was finished , cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole , although he retained the captured gunboats . zamboanga cooke led his small squadron past corregidor on january and turned south . four days later in a storm one of the gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again , lost with its twelve crew . the frigates subsequently scouted mindanao before reaching zamboanga on january . there cooke raised spanish colours in an attempt to deceive the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but sybille grounded on a sandbank at the entrance to the port which raised the suspicions of a guardboat sent by the governor of zamboanga , raymundo espaol . the captain of the spanish boat asked the british ships the names of their captains , and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle fire , he put the town on alert . with the defenders forewarned , cooke abandoned his ruse and after refloating sybille the following morning , ordered a bombardment of the fort protecting the harbour . this had little effect , though later the spanish recovered at least cannonballs from different calibers , and malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm the landward side of the fort . the boats came under heavy fire , one smashed by a cannonball , killing two and wounding four . another boat grounded on a sandbar and became stuck so with his force in disarray , as villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the british from the beach , malcolm called off the operation . after exchanging shot for an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out of range , with two dead and one wounded on sybille and eight wounded on fox , in addition to those lost in the boats . the defenders lost a single man killed and wounded . with his frigates now requiring repairs , cooke withdraw half a league from zamboanga and spent three days refitting the masts and rigging of the ships . then he sailed north , scuttling the two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to canton . four days later , on january the squadron halted at a village named pullock in the north of the sultanate of maguindanao to collect fresh water . on the beach a boat party from sybille was set upon by lumad tribesmen . two were killed and nine others taken captive and dragged into the forest before rescuers could arrive . cooke complained to sultan kibab sahriyal at kuta wato and the captured sailors were eventually recovered , although not before sybille and fox had sailed for china to escort the merchant convoy back to india . aftermath cooke s opportunistic diversion had determined that the spanish forces in the philippines posed no immediate threat , although the mission had cost lives admiral rainier later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the admiralty . more might have been achieved with reinforcements historian c. northcote parkinson suggests that had cooke s squadron united with resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed spanish warships at cavite . he also notes however that in this scenario pakenham would have been commanding officer , a man with considerably less imagination and guile than cooke . historian richard woodman was critical of the mission , considering the operation to have no glorious outcome and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short coming . the china fleet sailed without further incident . during the ensuing year resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in july in the bangka strait , and the majority of rainier s forces were focused on disrupting the french occupation of suez in the red sea . this diversion of british resources created gaps in the coverage in merchant shipping and sercey was able to send the frigate preneuse and corvette brle gueule to manila late in the year to join the repaired spanish squadron . at the beginning of february , this combined force sailed to macau , taking the british defences by surprise . the british commander captain william hargood counterattacked , advancing on the franco spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the wanshan archipelago . the combined squadron then dispersed and the china fleet was not attacked again until the battle of pulo aura in , at which a french squadron was again driven off in confusion . the frigates cooke had mimicked , forte and prudente were sent to operate independently against british trade in the indian ocean in early . prudente was captured by hms daedalus at the action of february near southern africa , and forte was intercepted by hms sybille under cooke on february near balasore in bengal . in the ensuing battle forte was captured but cooke mortally wounded , dying on may . b of the bang b of the bang was a sculpture by thomas heatherwick next to the city of manchester stadium in manchester , england , which was commissioned to mark the commonwealth games it was one of the tallest structures in manchester and the tallest sculpture in the uk until the completion of aspire in . it was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the leaning tower of pisa . the sculpture took its name from a quotation of british sprinter linford christie , in which he said that he started his races not merely at the bang of the starting pistol , but at the b of the bang . the sculpture was commissioned in construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until january . six days before the launch , the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground . legal action started a year later , resulting in an out of court settlement totalling . million . in february , manchester city council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage . despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly , the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal . the core was sold for scrap in july , while the spikes remain in storage . design and statistics b of the bang originally stood metres ft tall with hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core . it was angled at degrees and supported by five m ft long , tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes m ft above the ground . the sculpture weighed tonnes , with the concrete in the foundations weighing over , tonnes , including a m , sq ft reinforced concrete slab . the foundations are m ft deep . the sculpture was made from the same weathering steel also known as cor ten as the angel of the north sculpture , which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements . this layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its permeability to water . as part of the design , the spikes swayed slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of mph km h . at the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture , containing children s poems and paintings , due to be opened circa . the location of the time capsule after dismantling is currently unknown . b of the bang was located next to the city of manchester stadium at sportcity , in beswick , at the corner of alan turing way and ashton new road . it took its name from a quotation of british sprinter linford christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the bang of the starting pistol , but at the b of the bang . the artwork had been nicknamed kerplunk by the locals after the popular children s game from the s . prior to the construction of aspire at the university of nottingham , b of the bang was britain s tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the angel of the north , which stands at feet m . it was designed to look like an exploding firework and was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the leaning tower of pisa . it was commissioned by new east manchester limited to commemorate the commonwealth games . the design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in and was designed by thomas heatherwick . construction and funding the sculpture was constructed in sheffield by thomas heatherwick studio , packman lucas , flint and neill and westbury structures . it was approved at the start of , with the central core arriving in manchester on june . this was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory , and required a police escort . this central core was lifted into place in august , after which the spikes could begin being attached . early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of july , which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname g of the bang . the official unveiling by linford christie took place on january . in total the sculpture cost . million to design and construct twice the original estimate , as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs . funding was sourced from a european regional development fund contribution of , , the north west development agency , contributing , , and manchester city council providing , . structural problems and legal action the tip of one of the . m . ft spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on january , only six days before the official unveiling . after inspection , the event went ahead as planned . four months later , in may , a second spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose . at that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed . as a result , some of the joints were re welded , with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement . this consisted of retrofitting tip weights to of the spikes weights . despite these modifications , b of the bang remained fenced off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to get it sorted . in may a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis , to discover the stresses being placed on the steel . it was announced in october that manchester city council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture , with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture . in november this culminated in an out of court settlement being reached between manchester city council , the project s designers thomas heatherwick studio ltd , and the engineering and construction subcontractors packman lucas ltd , flint and neill partnership and westbury structures ltd . the agreement was to pay the council .m in damages for breach of contract and negligence . dismantling acting on a report in january , the city council recommended that b of the bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement . the report recognised the sculpture s aesthetic value for manchester and manchester city council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long term solution . one possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre , although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing . in january , antony gormley , creator of the angel of the north to which b of the bang is often compared spoke out in support of the sculpture , stating that , it is a great tribute to manchester that this ground breaking work was commissioned . to allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council s nerve . despite gormley s plea , removal of b of the bang began in april . more substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm connell brothers limited began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment . although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs , these too were cut apart during removal , casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture s return , and in early july the core was sold as scrap for , . battle of the hongorai river the battle of the hongorai river took place during the second world war and involved australian , new zealand and japanese forces . part of the wider bougainville campaign of the pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the southern sector of bougainville island . coming after the battle of slater s knoll in which a strong japanese counterattack was defeated , the battle occurred in two distinct periods between april and may , as elements of the australian th brigade advanced south along the buin road . the initial phase saw the australians advance towards the hongorai river . following the end of the early fighting , the australian advance towards the main japanese concentration at buin continued as they struck out towards the hari and mivo rivers . this continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective , washing away many bridges and roads upon which the australians relied for supplies . as the australian advance stalled , the japanese began harassing the australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late july and into august , the australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards buin again . ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final australian advance began , bringing the campaign to an end . background strategic situation japanese forces had landed on bougainville in early , capturing it from the small force of australians garrisoning the island . they had subsequently developed several airbases on the island , using it to conduct operations in the northern solomon islands and to attack the allied lines of communication between the united states , australia and the southwest pacific area . these bases also helped protect rabaul , the major japanese garrison and naval base in papua new guinea , and throughout , allied planners determined that bougainville was vital for neutralising the japanese base around rabaul . us marines conducted an amphibious landing at cape torokina , on the western coast of the island , north of empress augusta bay , in november . after an initial counter attack , the us marines had been replaced by a garrison of us army troops who began consolidating their position around torokina , establishing a strong perimeter . in march , the japanese launched a heavy counter attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties . after this , the situation on bougainville became largely static , as the japanese focused primarily on subsistence , and the us forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around torokina . in late , as part of plans to free us troops up for the philippines campaign , the australian ii corps consisting of mainly militia troops under the command of lieutenant general stanley savige took over responsibility for allied operations on bougainville from the american xiv corps . australian forces began arriving on the island between november and december , initially establishing themselves around the us base at torokina . due to inaccurate intelligence , savige mistakenly believed that the japanese forces on the island numbered just , men , and he consequently decided that the australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the japanese from bougainville in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere , rather than maintaining the defensive posture the us forces had adopted . however , allied estimates of japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of japanese on the island at this time was closer to , . the campaign that australian planners developed entailed three separate drives in the north , it was planned that japanese forces would be forced into the narrow bonis peninsula and contained in the centre the seizure of pearl ridge would give the australians control of the east west avenues of approach , as well as affording them protection against further counter attacks , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast and the main campaign in the south , where the bulk of the japanese forces were concentrated around buin . preliminary moves following the capture of pearl ridge in december , the australian th brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards buin . in late march and early april , they had fought the battle of slater s knoll after which a brief lull followed as the australians paused to shorten their supply lines . meanwhile , the survivors of the japanese force , heavily demoralised by their defeat , withdrew towards the hongorai river . the australian rd division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the hari river , while the hongorai was also included as an intermediate objective . japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the australians at about , men , of which , were believed to be directly opposing the rd division . the th brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the australian units on bougainville at the time and was moved up to relieve the th brigade , which was in need of rest . under the command of brigadier heathcote hammer the th brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the th armoured regiment , engineers from the th field company , a battery of mm guns from u heavy battery , field artillery from the nd field regiment , and a number of smaller support units . the th th infantry battalion took over responsibility for slater s knoll replacing the th infantry battalion while the th infantry battalion took up a position across the buin road . the brigade s third battalion the th th infantry battalion did not join them until the beginning of may , and so the th brigade s th infantry battalion continued patrolling operations north of the huio river , in the rumiki area , until the th th could dispatch elements to relieve them . further inland , the th commando squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south east , defending the brigade s left , or eastern , flank . the japanese forces opposing the australians belonged to the th division , under the command of lieutenant general tsutomu akinaga . akinaga had been ordered to delay the australian advance between the hongorai and the hari for as long as possible , and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the australian s expected line of advance . the division s infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around slater s knoll and as a consequence , several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated . the front line positions were assigned to the th field artillery regiment , while the th infantry regiment was to hold five strongpoints to their rear along and astride the buin road , designated a through to e . the th field and th field heavy artillery regiments both held strongpoints further back , designated f and g . the rd infantry regiment was placed in the rear , where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack on slater s knoll . battle advance to the hongorai the th brigade took over the forward positions from the th brigade on april . initial dispositions had the th infantry battalion on the buin road around kero creek , with the th th around barara , north east of slater s knoll , and the th th , when it arrived to relieve the th , would be positioned further east astride a secondary , parallel track known to the australians as the commando road . two days later , hammer received the order to commence the advance towards the hongorai from savige , who offered him the support of the th brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter attack . in a change to the tactics that the australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around slater s knoll , from early may they advanced on a two battalion front , instead of one . the th infantry battalion was in the van , moving along the buin road with the th th protecting its flank and rear while , yd , m further inland the th th infantry battalion , commencing on may , advanced along the commando road from rumiki , after taking over from the th infantry battalion . moving forward under a creeping barrage as they moved beyond tokinotu , the th infantry battalion was the first to contact the japanese , carrying out an attack against japanese positions around dawe s creek on april . supported by a troop of matilda tanks from the th armoured regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over shells , two infantry companies c and d from the th attacked the position while another a company carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards kindara and hatai . the left forward company d company reached its objective without trouble however , c company on the right along with the troop of tanks came up against stiff japanese resistance and became bogged down . a company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the hatai track . in support of a company , matilidas came forward and raked the jungle , hacking through the undergrowth to reveal several japanese pillboxes , which were destroyed by the australian armour . as night fell , c company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning . engineers were brought forward , as was a bulldozer , and the gap was bridged . amidst heavy fighting , the australians forced their way across the creek . by the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation yd m beyond the creek , japanese had been killed for the loss of seven australians killed and wounded . after this , the australians continued their advance towards sindou creek , which was a further mi . km to the southeast . in response , the japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week , although these were turned back . during this time , the australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements , one of which managed to slip through the japanese defensive positions either side of the buin road and carried out a reconnaissance of the hongorai river about , yd m south of the main crossing . further patrols were carried out , as well as a number of ambushes , before the advance was resumed on april . resuming their advance , the australians were supported by three squadrons of corsairs from the royal new zealand air force nos. , and squadrons which bombed and strafed the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire . with such strong support the japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the th infantry battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the hongorai , for just one man wounded . further progress was made over the next week , but on may the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices . after this , the th brigade s engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . the japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . to negate the effectiveness of the australian tanks , the japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support . additionally , the japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire . meanwhile , the previous day , may , the th th infantry battalion had begun operating along the parallel commando road to the north . here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed . they also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on may . on may , along the buin road , the th infantry battalion had pressed forward again . advancing with a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately japanese . after the lead matilda s machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew . moving around the stricken tank , the second matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the japanese defenders from the position . that night , the japanese artillery opened up on the australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company sized counter attack . the fighting lasted for over two and a half hours , but when it was over the australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack . in doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking japanese had suffered heavily , losing men killed . it was the biggest loss since the action at slater s knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the hongorai . after this , the australians were able to resume their advance to the river on may without further opposition . the previous three weeks in which they had advanced , yd , m to the hongorai had been costly for them , however , with the australian th infantry battalion losing killed and wounded . against this , the japanese had lost at least killed . crossing the hongorai following the advance to the hongorai , there was a pause of about a week as the australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the hongorai en masse . this allowed savige to re evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the hari and mivo rivers . as they waited for the advance to resume , the australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time . as a part of these , the th infantry battalion sent a company across the hongorai and subsequently located a strong japanese position on a feature that became known as egan s ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main australian axis of advance . the main crossing was planned for may , with the th th infantry battalion on the right tasked to cut the buin road and the aitara track to the east of the river , while on the left the th th infantry battalion would divert the attention of the japanese off the th infantry battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the australian line , crossing at the pororei ford , advancing straight up the buin road . preliminary moves began before this , and on may a platoon from the th infantry battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on egan s ridge . after one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw . meanwhile , the rnzaf corsair squadrons now reinforced by no. squadron began an eight day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the buin and commando roads . during this period , the new zealanders flew sorties , while artillery and mortars fired thousands of rounds . two days later , on may , the th th infantry battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank , crossing the hongorai inland and advancing along the commando road with corsairs and two batteries of artillery in support . crossing yd m north of the ford , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing . nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on may . in the centre , the main attack along the buin road began at on may after minutes of strafing by new zealand corsairs had prepared the ground . advancing under a creeping barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the th infantry battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve , along with two troops of matilda tanks . mostly the forward companies reached their objectives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded . the attack was resumed the following day , and the australians were able to advance to the pororei ford however , they were prevented from moving any further as the japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an australian patrol encountered japanese and were forced to go to ground . finally , a company from the th infantry battalion was able to move on to the high ground on egan s ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped . engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature . on the right flank , the th th infantry battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the hongorai by bulldozer . beginning their move two days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with the japanese . meanwhile , using tractors to drag the tanks through the mud , the australian armour had crossed the river also and by on may the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , unbeknown to the japanese . the following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance . later , after one of the battalion s patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a mm gun and a large amount of ammunition . by may , although there were still a number of japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the australian objectives had been secured and mopping up operations began . the last remaining defensive location before the hongorai was egan s ridge , where the japanese were sheltering in tunnels . a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge . it was subsequently occupied by a company of australian infantry . within a short period of time the buin road was subsequently opened , providing the australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the hari , mobiai , and mivo rivers . the final phase of the battle cost the japanese killed , while the australians lost killed and wounded . aftermath during the course of the fighting around the hongorai , the australians lost men killed and wounded , while the japanese lost at least men killed . following the battle , the australians continued their advance towards buin at the southern end of the island . throughout the remainder of the month and into june , the th brigade advanced along the buin road , crossing the hari on june . beyond the river , the japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep entrenchments . these were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the th brigade subsequently crossed mobiai river before being relieved by brigadier noel simpson s th brigade in early july . as the th brigade advanced toward the mivo river , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt . the height of the river rose metres . ft . the buin road was reduced , in the words of gavin long , to a sea of mud and many of the bridges upon which the australian supply system was dependent were washed away . this rendered large scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the australians even ceased patrolling operations across the mivo meanwhile , the japanese continued to harass the australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the australian line of communications . on july , the th infantry battalion fought off a series of attacks around siskatekori , at the junction of the mivo river and the buin road , which included a heavy japanese artillery bombardment . australian patrols were resumed in late july and continued into august . these attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding . fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also , and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards buin continued into august , combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed . as a result , the final australian operations on bougainville took place on the ratsua front in the northern sector , where the australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at porton plantation had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the bonis peninsula . by mid august , however , following the dropping of two atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki and japan s subsequent unconditional surrender , a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this , it spelt an end to major combat operations . following the end of the war , the australian army awarded three battle honours for the fighting around the hongorai river . the th armoured regiment , and the th , th , th th and th th infantry battalions received the battle honour hongorai river . a second battle honour egan s ridge hongorai ford was also awarded to the th armoured regiment , and the th and th th infantry battalions for the second stage of the fighting , while the th th infantry battalion received the separate battle honour of commando road for this period . sonic the hedgehog video game sonic the hedgehog is a platform video game developed by sonic team and published by sega for the sega genesis console . the game was first released in north america , europe and australia in june , and in japan the following month . the game features an anthropomorphic hedgehog named sonic in a quest to defeat dr. robotnik , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical chaos emeralds . sonic the hedgehog s gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button . the game s development began in , when sega ordered its am development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company . after considering a number of suggestions , the developers decided on a blue hedgehog with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves sonic team to match their character . sonic the hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , was influenced by the games of super mario series creator , shigeru miyamoto . sonic the hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows sonic s sprite to roll along curved scenery , which originated in a tech demo created by the game s programmer , yuji naka . the game was well received by critics , who praised its visuals , music , and speed of gameplay . the game was also commercially successful , establishing the genesis as a key player in the bit era and allowing it to compete with nintendo and their super nes console . it has been ported a number of times , and inspired several clones , a successful franchise , and adaptations by other media . plot in an attempt to steal the six chaos emeralds and harness their power , the game s antagonist , dr. ivo robotnik , has trapped the animal inhabitants of south island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules . the player controls sonic , who aims to halt robotnik s plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the emeralds himself . if the player collects all the chaos emeralds and completes the game , a reward ending sequence is shown . if all the emeralds are not collected , robotnik taunts the player while juggling the chaos emeralds instead . gameplay sonic the hedgehog is a d , side scrolling platformer , whose gameplay centers around sonic s ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs , slopes , high falls , and loop the loops . the levels contain hazards in the form of robots badniks in the western game manuals inside of which dr. robotnik has trapped animals . although destroying a robot frees the animal within , this is not required to complete the game . the player must avoid rows of sharp spikes , falling into bottomless pits , being crushed by moving walls or platforms , and drowning which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents . sonic s main attack is his spin , where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly damaging enemies and some obstacles . this can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground . scattered around each level map are gold rings , and collecting rings rewards the player with an extra life . rings are a layer of protection against hazards if sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or obstacle , he will survive . however , all his rings will be scattered they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again . if sonic is hit without any rings , he loses a life . although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection , certain hazards such as drowning , being crushed , falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time will cost sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection . the game is divided into six zones green hill , marble , spring yard , labyrinth , star light , and scrap brain , each with its own visual style and enemies . a player must navigate through each zone subdivided into three acts to progress . at the end of each zone s third act , the player confronts dr. robotnik who pilots a different vehicle each time in a boss fight . after the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the final zone for a last encounter with robotnik . the player begins with three lives power ups and rings add more , which are lost when sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects without rings , falls off screen or exceeds an act s ten minute time limit . lampposts acting as checkpoints allow sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life . if he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life , the timer will reset to when he returns to the checkpoint . if all lives are lost at any point in the game , the game over screen will appear when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives , if they have any continues . when sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings , a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a special stage a secret zone in the original genesis manual . in each of six special stages , sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack . although the player earns a continue with each rings found , their main goal is to obtain the chaos emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a goal block which ends the level . development background and character design in , sega ordered its in house development studio , am , to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company . this was a position already held by the character alex kidd , but he was considered similar to mario and deemed unsatisfactory sega president hayao nakayama wanted a character as iconic as mickey mouse . sega had competition from nintendo and its mascot , mario , in mind nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful super mario bros. , and sega wanted a foothold in the industry . although the company had some success with genesis ports of its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough . am developed ideas for characters , an engine , and gameplay mechanics . development emphasized speed , so am eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals , as well as fast creatures like kangaroos and squirrels . one idea , a rabbit able to grasp objects with prehensile ears , showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware . the team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball , their idea for an attacking move . designers then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough , so they focused on two animals with spikes armadillos and hedgehogs . the hedgehog character , first proposed by naoto ohshima , prevailed , although the armadillo would later become the basis for mighty the armadillo who first appeared in s segasonic the hedgehog . ohshima has admitted since that he created sonic s basic design by combining felix the cat s head with mickey mouse s body . sonic was originally teal colored , then a light shade of blue , but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the sega logo . his shoes were colored red through the inspiration of michael jackson s boots on the album cover for bad and the outfit of santa claus , whom ohshima saw as the most famous character in the world . sonic s spikes were emphasized to make him look sleeker , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button . the new character was originally named mr. needlemouse , but the eight member am changed his name to sonic and their studios to sonic team . ideas proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band , giving him vampire fangs , and giving him a human girlfriend named madonna , but sega of america scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple . sega of america also expressed concerns that most americans would not know what a hedgehog is and initially proposed a full scale recreation of the character , but compromised with sonic team to simply make design changes . the antagonist ended up being named dr. eggman in japan and dr. robotnik in other regions as a result of a dispute between sega s american and japanese divisions . programming and prototyping with a satisfying protagonist completed , sega turned to esteemed programmer yuji naka , who had impressed them through his work on phantasy star and the genesis port of ghouls n ghosts . the gameplay originated with a tech demo by naka , who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix . naka s prototype was a platform game with a fast moving character rolling in a ball through a long , winding tube , and this concept was fleshed out with ohshima s character designs and levels by designer hirokazu yasuhara . yasuhara originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the united states by the outbreak of the gulf war , but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year . his designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design . the game s color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist eizin suzuki , and the aesthetics of green hill were influenced by the geography of california . in designing the game mechanics , naka was inspired by shigeru miyamoto , whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier . admiring the simplicity of miyamoto s mechanics in complex environments , naka decided that sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping . he also wanted his creation to be more action oriented than the mario series while playing super mario bros. , he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly . due to the need to demonstrate the genesis technological prowess , the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign , a process taking over six months . the developers efforts were rewarded according to yuji naka , the game had the fastest ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console . the team intended to add a two player mode displayed via split screen , but naka s programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature . however , such a mode would later appear in sequel sonic the hedgehog , where the second player would control sonic s best friend miles tails prower . naka , oshima , and yasuhara worked hours a day on the project for several months . naka s relationship with sega of japan was tenuous during this time he received little credit for his involvement in the game . he left the company shortly after the game s release , although sega of america hired him later . before leaving , however , he defied sega of japan s prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background , identifiable only by looking at the game s code . music the music for sonic the hedgehog was composed and produced by masato nakamura , bassist and lead songwriter of the j pop band dreams come true . the game uses onboard yamaha ym and sn programmable sound generators to produce a variety of stereo sound effects and music . it was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations of sonic breakdancing to the music of a sonic band of sharps chicken on guitar , max monkey on bass , mach rabbit on drums , and vector the crocodile on keyboard . the playable vector became a recurring character in the series , also appearing in knuckles chaotix , sonic heroes , and sonic free riders . the development schedule scrapped the feature , and yuji naka replaced the test with the se ga chant used in tv commercials which reportedly used one eighth of the memory of the four megabit cartridge . on october , , twenty years after the game s release , a three disc compilation of music from sonic the hedgehog and sonic the hedgehog was released in japan . the first disc features original tracks from both games , the second contains masato nakamura s demo recordings and the third comprises songs by dreams come true and their akon remixes . packaging and release game package illustrator akira watanabe said that his goal was to make the characters colorful , using clear lines and gradation to finish them neatly . according to watanabe , the developers asked him to create a package design similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages something original and stylish . the game was released in north america , europe , and australia on june , , and in japan on july . sega of america packaged it with american genesis consoles , replacing altered beast . genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of sonic the hedgehog by mail . sega of america created a large scale marketing campaign to promote the game and sonic as a mascot for the company . alternate versions and ports bit version a version of sonic the hedgehog was developed by ancient and released in for sega s bit consoles , the master system and game gear . its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the bit version , with different level themes and digital assets . the level design is flatter , with no vertical loops , and sonic cannot re collect his rings after being hit . the game has a different soundtrack , composed by chiptune musician yuzo koshiro and including his compositions and adaptations of music from the bit version . it was the final game released for the master system in north america . the master system version was re released for wii s virtual console service in north america on august , , and in europe on august . the game gear version was re released for the nintendo ds virtual console on june , , and included as an unlockable game in sonic adventure dx director s cut for gamecube and windows and sonic mega collection plus for playstation , xbox , and windows . sonic

features , such as the ability to save game progress , a level select option , and an anniversary mode with the spin dash move not originally implemented until sonic the hedgehog . its screen is slightly zoomed in , and adapted to the gba s widescreen aspect ratio . the game received poor reviews , with a metacritic score of percent the chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the game boy advance resulting in a slow frame rate , remixed chunky music , and poor preservation of the original gameplay . compilation releases with its sequels for the genesis , sonic the hedgehog has been ported for a wide range of home and handheld consoles and personal computers . it has appeared in sonic compilation for the genesis , sonic jam for the sega saturn and game.com , sonic mega

part of the nintendo ds d classics line in may in japan , and worldwide in december . reception sonic the hedgehog was critically praised at its release and in retrospective reviews , with an percent approval rating at the review aggregator gamerankings based on nine reviews . the game rivaled the mario series , particularly super mario world which was recently released for genesis rival super nintendo entertainment system . paul rand of computer and video games compared the two in depth and characterized sonic the hedgehog as being faster , with brighter colors , and super mario world as having more depth of play . reviewers noted the game s colorful , detailed graphics . rand called its color scheme lively , but never garish , praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites , backgrounds , and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the genesis . reviewer boogie man of gamepro called the intricate backgrounds eye popping and gorgeous , which was echoed by mean machines . according to the lessers hartley , patricia , and kirk of dragon , the graphics and animation in sonic the hedgehog make this a serious contender for the best video game of the year and gamezone called the animation some of the smoothest and fastest ... ever seen . the music and sound effects were also well received dragon called them great , and gamezone amazing . rand noted stacks of catchy tunes and jingles , calling some of the sound effects absolutely brilliant . although mean machines called the songs vaguely appealing , the game s sound effects were better appreciated . critics cited the fast gameplay , unprecedented in platformers . gamepro s boogie man noted its lightning fast action and , according to electronic gaming monthly egm , if you thought the enterprise was quick , wait till you see sonic at warp speed . the game s difficulty was disputed , described as impossible by rand and average by egm . rand said about the gameplay in general that it plays like a dream according to gamezone it would enchant players for hours , and boogie man praised sonic team s ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping . although egm , dragon , and paul of mean machines praised the level design especially the hidden rooms , paul found losing all of one s rings frustrating . sonic the hedgehog has maintained its popularity , appearing on lists of the greatest video games of all time . frank provo of gamespot described the game as one of the best platformers of all time , noting that despite technical issues in the game boy advance port after all these years , the underlying graphics , audio , and gameplay still hold up . lucas m. thomas of ign agreed that it stood the test of time you ll be impressed by the clarity and color that come through ... few people realize how difficult it was to create sonic s graphics engine , which allowed for the incredible rate of speed the game s known for . but the technical achievement impressed back in , and still does so today . mega ranked the game its third favorite genesis title , and in game informer called it the th greatest game of all time . sonic the hedgehog has been a commercial success the original genesis version sold over million copies by february , and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by . legacy effect on the industry primarily because of its genesis bundling , sonic the hedgehog contributed to the console s north american popularity . during october december , the genesis outsold the super nes by a two to one ratio , and at its january peak claimed percent of the market for bit consoles . although nintendo eventually again overtook sega , this was the first time since december that the company did not lead the console market . sonic the hedgehog added speed and momentum based physics to the standard platform formula . set pieces and mechanics introduced by the game such as loops , springs , and acceleration pads have appeared in other games and become associated with the sonic series . a flood of animal with attitude platformers , each featuring a cartoon mascot , were released after sonic the hedgehog bubsy , aero the acro bat , james pond , earthworm jim , zero the kamikaze squirrel , awesome possum , ty the tasmanian tiger , gex . this carried into the playstation era with games like punky skunk and crash bandicoot . sequels and other media the game s success led sega to develop an extensive media franchise . a sequel , sonic the hedgehog , gave sonic a best friend and sidekick named miles tails prower and continued the fight against dr. robotnik . sonic has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters keeping sonic and robotnik as mainstays , surviving the end of sega console manufacturing after the dreamcast . the series has ventured from platformers to fighting , racing , role playing , and sports games , and has expanded into anime and manga , cartoons and comic books , novels , and toys . sonic the hedgehog has become one of the best selling video game franchises of all time , with over million copies sold by may . the game s first stage , green hill zone , has also been re purposed for use in several other titles such as sonic adventure , sonic generations and the super smash bros. series . the same old story the same old story is the second episode of the first season of the american science fiction drama television series fringe . the episode was written by executive producer jeff pinkner and co creators j. j. abrams , alex kurtzman , and roberto orci . when developing the series , they sought to find a medium between serialized drama and the crime procedural . the same old story was the first regular episode of fringe , and journalists viewed it as an example of what they could expect from the series . it was directed by paul a. edwards . after a newborn baby rapidly ages into an year old man , fringe division agent olivia dunham anna torv and consultants peter joshua jackson and walter bishop john noble investigate . they tie the case to the murders of young women , who have all had their pituitary glands removed . it is revealed that dr. claus penrose mark blum , an expert in progeria , is working to help his son christopher derek cecil stay alive , as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome . the same old story first aired in the united states on september , on fox . an estimated . million viewers watched the episode , a percent increase from the series premiere . the episode received mixed reviews from television critics reviewers thought it was an improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot contrivances . plot a prostitute is abandoned by an unknown man at a hospital , dangerously in labor . she dies as the doctors perform a caesarean section , but the child ages rapidly in minutes , soon dead having aged to the likes of an year old man . olivia dunham anna torv , peter bishop joshua jackson , and walter bishop john noble , new members of the fringe division , are called to investigate by division head phillip broyles lance reddick , believing the case to be part of the pattern , a string of mysterious incidents . the woman is identified as having recently left a local motel , and olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner john scott were not able to solve . olivia explains to peter that their murderer would paralyze his victims , young women , then make an incision along their face to extract a piece of brain material , killing the victim in the process . walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth , her child having accelerated aging disease . walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field , and remembers where he stashed his car that contains the related files . once they are retrieved , olivia makes a connection to the pituitary gland which controls growth in humans , and informs charlie francis kirk acevedo to monitor recent cases where the victims pituitary gland has been removed . olivia and peter turn to an expert in progeria , dr. penrose mark blum , to trying to learn more about rapid aging , but dr. penrose cannot help them further , though peter suspects he is hiding something . unseen by the fringe division , dr. penrose visits an abandoned warehouse and meets the murderer , christopher derek cecil , his son , who suffers from rapid aging syndrome . penrose warns christopher to be careful and that they only need one more woman to complete the process . by this time , charlie has found a recent murder victim killed in the same fashion as olivia s serial murderer . at walter s lab , they identify the pituitary gland has been removed . they rationalize the murderer must extract hormones from the glands to slow down his own aging process . walter hypothesizes they can discover the location of the crime by looking at the images left in the woman s optical nerves induced by the paralyzing sedative . borrowing an electronic pulse camera from massive dynamic , they discover the image of a suspension bridge near stoughton and identify the likely location from which it was viewed the same warehouse that dr. penrose visited . the fbi converge on the building , and olivia and peter find penrose about to cut into another victim . olivia chases off after christopher , who eventually succumbs to his rapid aging and dies , while peter , after nicking penrose with a bullet , confers with walter to apply a makeshift defibrillator to bring the victim back to life . as they wrap up the case , olivia , peter , and walter complete forms to finalize their position in the fringe division . when peter is out of earshot , walter learns from olivia that the fbi medical files on peter s childhood are void of any details . production co creators j. j. abrams , alex kurtzman and roberto orci , and executive producer jeff pinkner wrote the episode . paul a. edwards served as the director , his first such credit for the series . in developing fringe , the co creators did not want to make the series too serialized , as this was a complaint often directed at abrams television series alias . they wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content , and studied procedural dramas such as law and order and csi crime scene investigation for inspiration . kurztman explained , while we make sure that our episodes are self contained have a beginning , a middle , and an end the character stories can be serialized . they don t have to resolve themselves over the course of one show . the same old story was fringe s first regular episode , and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured . the episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series different departments . for the scene in which they remove the victim s eyeball , the special effects crew created a mold based on actress elizabeth stanley s head . using plaster to make a prosthetic , they drilled out the eyeball and sculpt ed it open and went through a series of molds . stanley stated that it s really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me , even though it s very gruesome because the eyeball s popping out . the prop department rigged a weapon which they called a photon gun according to prop master peter gelfman , this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people s clothing for concealed weapons . vfx supervisor christopher scollard explained that for the eye s last vision , they used a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location , which they then used to take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab . the same old story featured guest appearances by actors derek cecil as christopher penrose and mark blum as his father , dr. claus penrose . other guest actors included betty gilpin as loraine amber daisy alcott , bernie mcinerney as old christopher penrose , carmen goodine as amy , ty jones as a doctor , and karin agstam as john scott s sister . reception ratings the same old story was watched by . million viewers in the united states , a percent increase of four million from the pilot . fox claimed that this ratings improvement was the best for any new network drama series in over five years . its high rated lead in , house , helped boost fringe s ratings for the night , as percent of house s total audience and percent of to year olds stayed to watch fringe . fringe was also the highest rated program for male to year olds that evening . reviews the same old story received mixed reviews from television critics . tv squad writer jane boursaw thought the episode seemed all over the place , and wasn t sure what to think . she stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when walter removed the girl s eye in order to identity her killer , and the cliffhanger at the very end , when walter states if you ve read my file , then you know the truth about peter s medical history . travis fickett of ign thought it was better than the pilot though it was laden with lots of clunky exposition and clichd dialogue , fickett understood that it was needed to acquaint new viewers to the show . fickett concluded his review by saying fringe has the potential to be a great show , and he also praised the production level as top notch , and torv s performance as very good as she brings a unique presence to the show . the a.v. club critic noel murray gave the episode a c , while television without pity graded it with a b. josh jackson of paste magazine disliked the deus ex machina aspects that neatly solved the puzzles of the first two episodes , and also criticized perceived plot contrivances like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim . despite these flaws , jackson said he would tune in next week because he would rather have a show err on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable , and i m interested to see if abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve . erin fox of tv guide also liked the same old story better than the pilot because she thought that it had really cool special effects , awesome walter isms , and actual chemistry forming between olivia and peter , and we also got to delve more into the connections between walter , nina sharp , massive dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before walter was institutionalized . a ugo networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes , but after sitting down to watch fringe s second episode , the same old story , my concerns have vanished . fringe s second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without sacrificing any of fringe s eleven herbs and spices . in fact , the subtle framework of what makes fringe not x files is even better defined in the first weekly episode . i d struggled to find the word to describe it , and the winner is condensed . the same old story has all of the sense of mystery , discovery , and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller , more combustible space . another ugo writer , alex zalben , later compared the same old story to the similarly plotted the x files episode dd kalm . zalben concluded that fringe wins this one , just for having a slightly less stupid explanation . randy blythe manslaughter case the randy blythe manslaughter case was a court case in the czech republic , stemming from a lamb of god concert in prague , wherein year old fan daniel nosek sustained head injuries leading to a coma and subsequent death . during the investigation , czech police unsuccessfully asked united states authorities for cooperation . when the band returned to the czech republic for another concert two years later , its vocalist randy blythe was arrested , charged with causing nosek s death , and remanded in custody for five weeks . according to a verdict delivered by the municipal court in prague on march , , it was proven that blythe had thrown nosek offstage and thus had moral responsibility for his death . however , due to the circumstances , blythe was not held criminally liable , and most of the blame lay with promoters and security members . the acquittal was upheld by the prague high court on june , . concert incident during a concert on may , , in the prague club , abaton , blythe was involved in an incident that resulted in the death of daniel nosek , a year old attending fan . according to eyewitness statements cited by the czech online daily newspaper aktuln.cz following blythe s arrest , blythe was chanting come on up between songs , which , the newspaper stated , may have been intended to invite applause from the audience and not a direct invitation to fans . the newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb onstage and was thrown by the singer from the stage , falling backwards directly on his head . according to the same paper , nosek was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol , suffered serious brain trauma , fell into a coma , and died weeks later from his injuries . a report about the concert at issue released on may , by topzine.cz stated that one of the things that was unexpected was the behavior of the singer randall blythe , who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage . the article also contains pictures , one of them showing blythe holding a fan down on the ground . meanwhile , another report released two days after the concert by metalopolis.net alleged that randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an impertinent fan , who has climbed the podium several times . the front man clearly showed that it is his territory , he struck the intruder down , punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium , without even stopping singing on may , , the report by marastmusic.com stated that some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage , while abysszine.com stated that the only negative thing about the concert was , to say it mildly , disputable approach of the band towards the stage divers ... when somebody tried to climb the stage , he was brutally swept down . following blythe s arrest , tom fiala , a promoter of the concert , said that there was no fight between the fan and blythe , and that it was an unfortunate incident which happened during the concert when someone climbed onto the stage where he was not supposed to be . according to the lamb of god publicist adrenaline pr , the incident deals with a fan that three times during the concert jumped the barricade and rushed randy during the performance . it is alleged that the third time , security was not able to reach him and that randy pushed him back into the audience where supposedly he fell and hit his head . however , it was revealed during the trial that it was a different fan who previously got into contact with blythe than nosek . guitarist willie adler said , i can t recall that particular show , let alone a fan being beaten on the stage . i think i would ve noticed something like that considering the dime thing . according to blythe s attorney martin radvan , the police launched an investigation following the death of nosek , about a month after the concert and following a coma . after interviewing several eyewitnesses from the concert , the police asked the united states department of justice to take part in the investigation however , they refused to cooperate and , moreover , did not notify anyone from lamb of god or its management . arrest and charges on june , , blythe was arrested by the czech police on suspicion of manslaughter . lamb of god was prepared to play in prague on june , , but blythe s arrest upon arrival at ruzyn airport caused the concert to be canceled . according to tv nova , blythe stated that he had not been aware of nosek s death and expressed his remorse . a police spokesperson stated on june , that the police had formally charged blythe under section of the czech criminal code , which contains intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death i.e. manslaughter . he faced years of imprisonment if found guilty . randy s brother mark blythe said the charge was bogus and outrageous and will be dropped immediately . court remand and bail on june , , the state attorney brought a motion to remand blythe in pre trial detention , as he considered blythe a flight risk . during a hearing conducted the same day , judge petr fassati of the prague district court ruled that blythe will be held on remand , with the possibility of a bail of czk , , us , , blythe s alleged annual income blythe was held in pankrc prison . bail was deposited in the court s bank account on mid day of july , . after this , the state attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint . due to public holidays it was not until july , , that the state attorney filed his complaint , which was to be dealt with by appellate court , the prague municipal court . on july , , prague municipal court s panel of three judges headed by judge lubo vrba overturned the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to czk million us , . after this , the state attorney challenged the conditions of release , trying to achieve that the bail is subject to blythe staying in the country and or blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished . on august , , the appellate court rejected the state attorney s second complaint and ordered blythe s immediate release . blythe left the czech republic the next day , claiming in an interview with tv nova that he would return for the trial . indictment and trial on november , , the spokesperson of the prague state attorney s office announced that the police had formally closed their investigation and proposed to the state attorney to indict blythe . after reviewing the case file , the state attorney indicted blythe on the aforementioned charges on november , . two weeks later , a judge set the trial to commence on february , , with a plan to conduct the hearings in four consecutive days . blythe was summoned to attend the hearing in person . the case was heard by a panel of the prague municipal court , consisting of presiding professional judge tom kubovec and two lay judges . trials in the czech republic are public . in general , the court is bound to decide on the deed as stated in the indictment however , it is not bound by its legal assessment by the state attorney . both the defendant and the state attorney may appeal the decision the appeal would be heard by a panel of the prague high court , consisting of three professional judges . a decision of second instance court is final and enforceable . nevertheless , an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by the defendant or the supreme state attorney , which would be heard by the supreme court of the czech republic in brno an extraordinary appeal may , however , rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case . after exhausting all of these remedies , the defendant may also lodge a petition to the constitutional court of the czech republic . the petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the czech constitution and charter of fundamental rights and basic freedoms . state attorney vladimr muk indictment against blythe was brought by state attorney vladimr muk . muk had tried a number of murderers , such as lubo mika life in prison , roman fidler life imprisonment at st instance , years on appeal , maria zolotukinov years imprisonment and petr prochzka years imprisonment . he also tried a case against andranik soghojan , an alleged head of russian mafia , requesting years in prison for ordering a murder . the municipal court in prague acquitted soghojan due to lack of evidence however , the decision was repealed on appeal by the high court , and the case will be heard again by a different tribunal of the municipal court . another of muk s murder cases which ended in acquittal due to insufficient evidence is that of miroslav rus , who was indicted in connection with disappearance of miroslav k , a vice chairman of the czech football association . defense lawyers randy blythe was represented by prague lawyers martin radvan and vladimr jablonsk . radvan studied law at the faculty of law of charles university and at the new york university . from to , he served as external advisor of the then prime minister marin alfa . a former partner at baker mckenzie , radvan established radvan co. in . he is also a member of board of directors of forum . jablonsk gained fame as attorney of yekta uzunoglu , a kurdish national who was first charged in with preparing to commit three murders and committing blackmail and torture . it became one of the longest criminal cases in the czech history , as the witnesses and alleged victims gradually withdrew or changed their testimonies against uzunoglu until he was exonerated by the municipal court in prague in . the court held that although the crimes did take place , there is no evidence that uzunoglu took part in it . he was also defending judge pavel nagy , who was indicted of accepting a bribe . the proceedings ended with nagy being found insane and criminally not liable . jablonsk also acted as a defense attorney in the case of a hairdresser of czech vips indicted on charges of rape and torture . during the proceedings , the judge sent jablonsk to face the disciplinary commission of the czech bar association for what he perceived as behaviour bordering on contempt . day of the trial the trial started on february , . blythe testified that when he wanted to see the club before the concert , lamb of god s technician told him that the club was terrible and messy . according to blythe , the technician went on , saying that the stage was small , there were too many people , and that it was rather dangerous . blythe , who is nearsighted , took off his glasses before entering the stage , which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half blind . blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage . one of the fans , who was identified as milan podek by czech newspapers , and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings , managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security . blythe testified that during the first attempt , podek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving . the second time , he tried to put his arms around blythe in an attempt to hug him . blythe , who according to his own words perceived this as a danger , caught podek s collar , pushed him on the ground , knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop . he then led the fan by his hair to the edge of the stage , where the fan jumped off . it was only after watching a video of the incident that blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back . blythe further said that he saw podek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security . later , when another fan tried to climb the stage , blythe thought that it was podek again . blythe testified that he approached the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him , which it did not . ji choro , author of video which caught the previous incidents with podek , testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him . blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up . blythe insisted that he never saw nosek nor came into contact with him . it was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about nosek s death . blythe further testified that he was not under the influence of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs . chris adler , lamb of god s drummer , testified that he had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that blythe s aggressiveness is only a stage act . according to adler , blythe is a calm , moderate , and well read person . the defense also presented videos from various lamb of god concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that blythe regularly cheers to the crowd , but not to encourage people to climb the stage . blythe also alleged that after learning about nosek s death , he had written a letter to the nosek family , in which he offered help and a meeting in person . daniel nosek s father , however , testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team . nosek s father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident . the nosek family s representative brought a claim for damages in the amount of czk , , approx . us , . day of the trial altogether , eight witnesses delivered their testimonies on february , . among them were friends of daniel nosek . nosek and three friends had come to attend the concert from vrchlab , a town in mountains some kilometres mi northwest of prague . they described nosek as a huge fan of lamb of god who had been able to secure an autograph from a guitar player before the concert had started . nosek s friend jan jebav testified that nosek climbed the stage , and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by blythe off the stage . he said he was sure blythe pushed nosek with both hands . he further said that blythe s behavior deviated from all the concerts he had attended in the past , commenting that blythe was visibly furious . he further claimed that nosek was not the first person to be chased off the stage by blythe , with another fan being kicked , choked and receiving a punch from blythe . jebav corroborated blythe s testimony that blythe asked are you okay after nosek fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply . however , as nosek fell sick after the concert , they called him an ambulance . according to jebav , the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it . nosek s other friend ondej vlach testified that nosek s fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore . nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage . according to him , blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off . while the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage , nosek fell directly on the ground . according to vlach , there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break . vlach further testified that after the fall , nosek went to sit on a bench , where he was fetched a water bottle . nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge at the back of his head , they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion . vlach said that he understood blythe s gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage . another person to testify was robert havelka , who worked as a security guard the night of the incident . havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage , but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage . he testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured . he further said that the fan s fall might have been helped by someone else , perhaps the singer , though he did not see it precisely . blythe s defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in and at the court . among other things , one of the witnesses originally alleged that nosek and blythe shook hands or that one of them offered hand to another on stage however , at the court hearing , he testified that there was no prior contact between them . blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior . day of the trial milan podek , the fan whom blythe admitted to shoving off the stage , testified on the third day of the trial . podek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage . podek testified that blythe knocked him down , knelt on him and held him down for a moment , but blythe definitely did not choke him . he also admitted that taking into account the fact that he podek was drunk and the way he acted , blythe s reaction was adequate . he commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage . another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that blythe s behavior was standard to metal concerts , saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception . she said that it was evident that blythe did not want any fans on the stage . neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of nosek s fall at the end of the concert . the judge also read a sworn statement from abaton s former producer , who stated that she had not known about the incident . she was aware that an ambulance was called that evening , but learned about the reasons for that only later , during the police investigation . the court further heard that lamb of god had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue , including that barriers should be placed . metres . ft from the stage . promoter tom fiala testified that although this was not the case , the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert . randy blythe was called again to the stand that day . the judge first alerted him that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions . the judge went again through the blythe s testimony and , with a view to the previous witness statements , asked blythe whether he insists that it was milan podek whom blythe threw off the stage . blythe responded by saying to the best of my knowledge , it was milan podek who was coming up on stage every time . also that day , expert medical witness michal pogoi took the stand . according to the prague post , pogoi testified that nosek s cause of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the brainstem . pogoi added that the mortality rate from this kind of injury is around percent , and that doctors couldn t have done more to save the patient . nosek was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue , where the initial diagnosis took place . since this hospital did not have a specialized neurology department , nosek was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis . there , nosek underwent two operations , first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone . finally , defense asked for adjournment as a key witness fell ill . the court decided to continue with the hearings the next day , after which the hearings would be adjourned until march , , in order to hear the defense s witness . blythe committed to return when the trial resumed . day of the trial on february , , only one witness took the stand before the hearing was adjourned . luk havlena contacted the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he didn t like the description of the situation by the previous witnesses . he said he did not think blythe was aggressive that night , and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show . he also said that each time somebody got on the stage , blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there . havlena testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive , somebody aided his fall from behind . he had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground . havlena had trouble recalling details from the show , as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in abaton , and thus could not describe , among other things , the position of the guardrail . day of the trial the trial resumed on march , with testimonies from expert witnesses in the fields of criminal psychology tereza soukupov , appointed by the court and psychiatry alena gayov , appointed by the defense . blythe returned to attend the hearings in person , even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence . the two expert witnesses agreed that blythe is not aggressive nevertheless , he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress . the court further heard testimonies from two eyewitnesses . one of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall . he testified that when by the exit , he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air . he said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage . the ambulance arrived minutes later . another eyewitness was a fan , alena rozsvalov , who testified that she saw blythe shove nosek , saying h e climbed onto the stage , and when he tried to stand up , blythe shoved him . according to her , the shove was strong enough for nosek to fall behind the front row of the fans into a place where no fans were staying at the moment . she testified that nosek fell backwards . another attendee of the concert who took the stand that day did not recall seeing any fall by the end of the concert . day of the trial a defense appointed expert witness in the field of biomechanics testified on march that nosek could not turn degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward , he could not have sustained an injury to the back of his head . he further said that if nosek fell over the first row of the fans , he must have been not only pushed , but must have jumped himself . the state attorney immediately attacked this testimony , claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time , as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies , according to which nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall . the presiding judge agreed with the state attorney on some of his points . in his closing speech , the state attorney asked the court to incarcerate blythe for years , claiming that even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury . a nosek family representative said that based on the witness testimonies , the family did not believe that blythe was solely responsible . he continued that he would not be substantiating the requested amount , as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered . he further added that daniel had died on his father s birthday , and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work . in his closing word , blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so . he further commented that in case of acquittal , measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at lamb of god concerts again . first instance verdict on march , , the court delivered a verdict , according to which blythe was not criminally liable for nosek s death , even though he had the moral responsibility for it . consequently , the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of blythe s bail . the court held that it was proven that blythe had thrown nosek off the stage . however , blythe , due to his nearsightedness , could have mistaken nosek for the other fan who had repeatedly gotten over the guardrail . according to the court , the largest part of the blame lies with the promoters and security members . judge kubovec further reproached blythe for not having met with the nosek family . the state attorney announced that he would appeal the verdict . appeals verdict the state attorney s appeal was heard by a panel of three judges of the prague high court , chaired by judge ji lnnika . the hearing took place in blythe s absence . blythe s acquittal was upheld by the panel on june , . the verdict may have been appealed by the supreme state attorney ssa to the supreme court . as the appeal hasn t been lodged by ssa within two months of the delivery of written second instance verdict , it has become final . in blythe demanded ca czk millions for damages but the municipal court for prague dismissed the suit . reaction in reaction to the arrest and detention , a fan created a petition at the official white house petition site . by the time blythe was released on bail , it gathered over , signatures . on july , , there was a vigil organized in lamb of god s hometown of richmond , virginia , by a friend of blythe s . at the event , gwar who are also from richmond frontman dave brockie said i don t think it was right for him to be arrested . i don t think it was right for him to be locked up .... this stuff could have all been worked out diplomatically or legally before he got there . in addition to brockie , other notable figures in heavy metal , such as tom araya and david draiman , have also come out in support of blythe . in a post to his blog , blythe explained that he met the nosek family in private after the trial , and promised them to be a spokesperson for safer shows . he emphasized that the family never attacked him and just wanted to know the truth of what had happened to their son . u.s. route in michigan us highway us is a component of the united states numbered highway system that connects everett , washington , to the upper peninsula up of the us state of michigan , with a separate segment that runs from rouses point , new york , to houlton , maine . in michigan , the highway runs through the up in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering the state at ironwood and ending at st. ignace in between , us briefly traverses the state of wisconsin . as one of the major transportation arteries in the up , us is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern midwest states . two sections of the roadway are included as part of the great lakes circle tours , and other segments are listed as state designated pure michigan byways . there are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along us that date to the s and s . the highway runs through rural sections of the up , passing through two national and two state forests in the process . the route of what became us was used as part of two indian trails before european settlers came to the up , and as part of the michigan segments of the theodore roosevelt international highway and the king s international highway auto trails in the early th century . the state later included these trails as part of m when the first state highway trunklines were designated in . most of m was redesignated as part of us when the us highway system was created on november , . since the s , several changes have reshaped the highway s routing through the up . one such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with hurley , wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of us closer to the lake michigan shoreline . with the creation of the interstate highway system , part of us was rerouted to coincide with the new interstate i , though in the s , the u.s. highway was truncated and removed from the i freeway , resulting in today s basic form . route description according to a regional planning committee report , us is a key highway for michigan , providing its main western gateway . the roadway plays an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the midwest , and is listed on the national highway system nhs for its entire length . the nhs is a network of roadways important to the country s economy , defense , and mobility . together with m , us is part of a pair of primary trunklines that bridge the eastern and western sides of the up . the . miles . km of roadway in michigan is divided into a . mile . km western segment and a . mile . km eastern segment , interrupted by a section that runs for . miles . km in the state of wisconsin . western segment us enters michigan from wisconsin for the first time north of downtown hurley , wisconsin , and ironwood , michigan , over the state line that runs along the montreal river . the highway crosses the river into gogebic county and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown . running along cloverland drive , us meets its only business route in michigan at douglas boulevard . the business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown ironwood and crossed the border into hurley and back to the main highway . the wisconsin department of transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line . us continues eastward through up woodlands to the city of bessemer . while bypassing the community of ramsay , the highway crosses a branch of the black river . the roadway enters wakefield on the south side of sunday lake , meeting m at a stoplight in town . as the us highway leaves wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the ottawa national forest , crossing jackson creek and two branches of the presque isle river . us and m merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the presque isle in the community of marenisco . this concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state in the michigan department of transportation mdot recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of vehicles , compared to the overall average of , vehicles for the highway . at the end of the concurrency , m turns northerly to run along lake gogebic . the highway continues parallel to the state line from the marensico area through the national forest toward watersmeet . that unincorporated community is the home of the watersmeet high school nimrods , the basketball team featured on a series of espn commercials and a documentary series on the sundance channel . the area is also where the waters meet the rolling hills drain to lake superior via the ontonagon river , to lake michigan via the brule and menominee rivers , or to the gulf of mexico via the wisconsin and mississippi rivers . also located in the area are the sylvania wilderness , and the lac vieux desert indian reservation , which includes the lac vieux desert casino and resort . the highway travels southeasterly from watersmeet around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural iron county . us intersects federal forest highway ffh near golden lake in stambaugh township in the middle of the national forest . the trunkline then runs along the iron river as it approaches the city of the same name and meets m . in town , us intersects m before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city . us leaves the ottawa national forest at iron river , and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to crystal falls , the county seat of iron county . on the west side of town , us meets us the two highways run concurrently along crystal avenue . the combined highway turns south onto th street and meets m s eastern terminus at the intersection between th street and superior avenue next to the county courthouse at the top of the hill . us us runs south out of crystal falls to the west of , and parallel to , the paint river . the roadway passes railroad , kennedy and stager lakes and leaves the state of michigan at the brule river , crossing into florence county , wisconsin for about miles km . eastern segment us us re enters michigan where it crosses the menominee river and subsequently meets m in breitung township north of iron mountain and kingsford . the highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on stephenson avenue into iron mountain along the west side of lake antoine , parallel to a branch line of the escanaba and lake superior railroad els railroad . the road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the chapin mine . in downtown iron mountain at ludington street , m turns west off stephenson avenue to run across town to kingsford . us us exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the midtown mall . the highway re enters breitung township where us separates to the south to re enter wisconsin . us continues eastward parallel to a branch of the canadian national railway cn railway . both road and rail travel through the community of quinnesec , where they pass near the largest paper mill in the up . the trunkline runs along the main street of norway , where the highway meets the eastern terminus of us . then us continues east through rural dickinson county to vulcan , passing north of hanbury lake through the copper country state forest , before crossing the sturgeon river in loretto and passing into menominee county . in menominee county , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along us . the highway passes through the edge of the community of hermansville before entering powers . us comes to a three way intersection and turns northeast merging onto us . the concurrent highway runs from powers through the communities of wilson and spaulding on the south side of the cn railway . at harris , the trunkline enters the hannahville indian community . harris is on the menominee county side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to bark river on the delta county side . the county line in between not only separates the two communities , but also serves as the boundary between the central and eastern time zones . east of bark river , the highway crosses the community s namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of m . the roadway crosses the ford river prior to turning due east into the outskirts of escanaba . us us widens to four lanes along ludington street , which forms the east west axis of the escanaba street grid . near downtown , the highway meets m , which runs along the city s north south axis , lincoln avenue . the trunklines merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor . lincoln avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the upper peninsula state fairgrounds , site of one of the two state fairs for the state of michigan , the only state to have twin fairs . us us m continues north on lincoln avenue past the campus of bay de noc community college . the four lane highway crosses the escanaba river just upstream from its mouth near the large mead paper mill and shifts to run immediately next to little bay de noc . the section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of us in the state an average of , vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in . the road turns inland again , and us us m passes to the west of downtown gladstone . the highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median and no driveway access . unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges . the highway intersects the eastern terminus of county road cr and crosses the els railroad south of the stoplight for th avenue north , where m separates from the us highways and turns to the northwest . the expressway continues north parallel to the cn railway , crossing the days river . through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of mph km h for car traffic . this is the only road in the up with a speed limit higher than mph km h besides i , which has a speed limit of mph km h . the expressway segment runs around the upper end of little bay de noc before ending at rapid river . in this location , us separates to the north , and us returns to an easterly track as a two lane road , crossing the rapid and whitefish rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay . as us crosses southern delta county , it passes through the western unit of the hiawatha national forest . near garden corners , the highway runs along the shore of big bay de noc . after the intersection with the northern terminus of m , us turns inland cutting across the base of the garden peninsula and enters schoolcraft county . as the highway approaches thompson , us leaves the western unit of the hiawatha national forest and enters the lake superior state forest . the roadway runs along lake michigan to manistique , crossing the manistique river . the trunkline turns inland approaching gulliver and then turns north northeast to blaney park . the community there is a former logging town turned resort at the southern terminus of m the resort was active from the late s but declined by the s . from blaney park , us turns due east and crosses into mackinac county west of gould city . where it intersects a former routing , the main highway crosses the cn railway one last time and runs to the south of engadine to follow the lake michigan shoreline through naubinway . after passing the community of epoufette , us crosses the cut river bridge , feet m over the cut river . the highway crosses into the eastern unit of the hiawatha national forest near brevort , running between lake michigan and brevort lake in the process . the road continues along the lake michigan shoreline , passing mystery spot near gros cap and turning inland immediately west of st. ignace . the us designation ends at the highway s partial cloverleaf interchange with i . the roadway continues easterly into downtown st. ignace as business loop i bl i . history indian trail through auto trails in , the first transportation routes through what became the state of michigan were the lakes , rivers and indian trails . two of these trails followed parts of the future us . the sault green bay trail roughly followed the lake michigan shoreline routing of us between escanaba and st. ignace . the mackinac trail connected st. ignace with sault ste . marie . in the age of the auto trail , the roads that later formed us through the up were given a few different highway names . when the original roadways between ironwood and iron river were completed in late , the upper peninsula development bureau updb named the area cloverland and the highway the cloverland trail . later the name was extended over the highway to escanaba , and to all highways in the area in the early s the name was phased out by the updb completely in . the roadways were also used for the theodore roosevelt international highway , named for former us president theodore roosevelt after his death in . overall , this highway ran from portland , oregon , to portland , maine , by way of michigan and the canadian province of ontario . through the up , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to us , including the section through florence county , wisconsin . the great lakes automobile route was established in by the updb . a predecessor of the great lakes circle tours by seventy years , the route followed a circular journey along the banks of lakes michigan and superior and green bay ... this route followed the modern us from ironwood to the m junction in manistique , using the modern m and m to stay in michigan . branches of the route followed us and m between powers and escanaba . the route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around lake michigan . the name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of world war i. one canadian auto trail was routed through the up as well . in , the king s international highway linked vancouver , british columbia , to halifax , nova scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of lake superior . motorists had to ship their cars by boat between sault ste . marie , ontario , and thunder bay or enter the united states to continue along the auto trail . the routings varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used us through the up from ironwood to sault ste . marie until a highway north of lake superior was opened in by that time , the auto trail had taken on the trans canada highway name . state trunkline the first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern us was m , a designation that was in use by july , , between ironwood and sault ste . marie . the first roadside park in the country was created by herbert larson near what is now us near iron river in , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside us grand river avenue in south of saranac . when the us highway system was created on november , , us partially replaced m . between crystal falls and iron mountain , us was routed through florence , wisconsin . the former routing of m from crystal falls to sagola became a new m when the former m became us now us . m from sagola south to iron mountain was made a part of an extended m , which is now m . by the next year , m was added along us from rexton to garnet as part of a larger extension . the first changes to the routing of us itself were made in with a bypass of downtown escanaba . a larger rerouting was completed in between rogers park and sault ste . marie . the new routing followed mackinac trail instead of turning east to cedarville and north to sault ste . marie the former routing was given the m designation . another realignment in the iron mountain area shifted us us to a new bridge over the menominee river between and . downtown ironwood was bypassed in , and the former route was initially designated m . the michigan state highway department mshd changed the routings and designations of the highways around cooks , thompson and manistique in the mid s . the agency rerouted us between cooks and m in thompson , turning the old road back to county control . the section between m and m was redesignated as an extension of m to thompson , and m was replaced by a further extension of m . the last change was to route us along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on august , . the mshd started construction in on a new road that rerouted us into st. ignace for the first time . between brevort and moran , us previously followed worth road inland to the tahquamenon trail to meet the northern extension of us into the upper peninsula . the new routing took us along the lakeshore into st. ignace . us was truncated to the state ferry docks in mackinaw city and us was routed through st. ignace along the former us to rogers park the connection in st. ignace to the state ferry docks became m . further changes in the early s straightened the roadway out near watersmeet and crystal falls . additional realignments were completed by the mshd to move us to its modern lakeshore routing between gould city and epoufette in . the new highway traveled due east from gould city to naubinway and then along the lake to epoufette . the former route through engadine was turned back to local control as far east as garnet . from there east , it was numbered just m , removing us from a concurrency . another former section into epoufette was added to extend m . the new highway was detoured around the cut river bridge until it was completed in after construction delays over steel shortages during world war ii . the western end of us took on two changes in the s . m was extended along us to the state line at ironwood from its western terminus at wakefield . a similar extension was made from m s eastern terminus to sault ste . marie in . the m designation was renumbered as business us by . the eastern m extension was reversed in , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by . interstate era with the coming of the interstate highway system in michigan , the mshd planned to convert the eastern section of us to a freeway between st. ignace and sault st. marie . in planning maps from , this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the interstates . it was also included in the general location of national system of interstate highways including all additional routes at urban areas designated in september , or yellow book after the cover color , that was released in as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system . the proposed number in was interstate i . the first section of freeway was built in late or early between evergreen shores and m north of st. ignace . the mackinac bridge was opened to traffic on november , a new section of freeway and an interchange connected us to the bridge . in , another new freeway segment closed the gap between the mackinac bridge and evergreen shores sections . at the time , the i designation supplanted us on the bridge , and us was shifted to follow i along the freeways in the st. ignace area . the former routing of us in downtown st. ignace was redesignated bl i . more sections of freeway were opened in immediately to the south of the newly constructed international bridge in sault ste . marie as well as between dafter and kinross . the last two sections opened in connected the northern end of the freeway at m to kinross , and the section between dafter and sault ste . marie . at this time , all of us s former routing became a county road known as mackinac trail h . the department of state highways expanded us us into an expressway between gladstone and rapid river in . the state built a new bridge over the manistique river in , bypassing downtown . mdot disposed of the former routing of us into downtown in two ways . the western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control . an extension of m replaced the remainder , including the siphon bridge , through downtown . in that same year , the department truncated us to end in st. ignace by removing it from the i freeway . the last changes were made to us s routing through iron river in , bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town . in , mdot raised the speed limit along the expressway section in delta county from to mph to km h , although the speed limit for trucks remains mph km h . memorial designations and tourist routes on july , , the state administrative board named m , the predecessor to us in michigan , the bohn highway to honor frank p. bohn , a prominent local citizen who later served in congress from to . in , the residents of escanaba created a memorial to the veterans of world war i called memory lane . the project consisted of elm and maple trees planted along us us west of town . the american legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers . later in , the bessemer women s club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans . also called memory lane , the group planted elms and , evergreens , trees and shrubs as a landscaped parkway along . miles . km of us east of bessemer . most of us , along with us in the lower peninsula , was designated the united spanish war veterans memorial highway in . to connect the gap in the routing where us cuts through wisconsin , m and m were used in place of us between iron mountain and crystal falls . signs marking the highway were not erected until when governor george w. romney had them installed . the amvets memorial drive designation was created for the section of us us m between the northern escanaba city limits and county road cr in delta county . the american veterans amvets organization in michigan petitioned the michigan legislature to grant this designation , which was assigned under public act in . two sections of us are part of the overall great lakes circle tour glct the segment from the wisconsin state line near ironwood to the m junction in wakefield is part of the lake superior circle tour lsct , and the segment from the southern m junction in escanaba to the eastern terminus in st. ignace is part of the lake michigan circle tour lmct . these two tours were created in may through a joint effort between mdot and its counterparts in wisconsin , minnesota and ontario . the section of us between iron river and crystal falls has been named the iron county heritage trail . this pure michigan byway was designated to honor the rich history of two industries that built a state and nation mining and logging . on august , , mdot announced that the section of us that runs concurrently with m in delta county was being included in the up hidden coast recreational heritage trail . historic bridges there are six bridges along current or former sections of us that mdot has added to its listing of michigan s historic bridges two of these are also listed on the national register of historic places nrhp . a third bridge added to the nrhp in late has not been added to mdot s listing however . the first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the iron river , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge . the original structure , dating to , is a foot long m spandrel arch span that was built by the mshd as trunk line bridge no. . the structure was listed on the nrhp on december , , for its architectural and engineering significance . in december , the national park service approved the listing of the upper twin falls bridge that crosses the menominee river northwest of iron mountain . the structure is a single span , pin connected , camelback , through truss bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in michigan . it was built between and because the twin falls power dam would flood an existing river crossing . the span cost , equivalent to , in , paid equally by dickinson and florence counties . until the s , the upper twin falls bridge carried us across the menominee river . in , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span . the bridge closed to automobile traffic in september , and the nomination process for inclusion on the national register of historic places began in . in , mdot replaced the sturgeon river bridge in waucedah township , dickinson county . as of october , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced , mdot retained it on their historic bridge list . it was built in . before , us used a different routing through manistique and crossed the manistique river on what is nicknamed the siphon bridge . built as a part of a raceway flume on the river , the water level is actually higher than the road surface . this produces a siphon effect , giving the bridge its nickname . the manistique pulp and paper company was organized in and needed a dam on the manistique river to supply their mill . this dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction . instead of expensive dikes , a concrete tank was built lengthwise in the river bed the sides of this tank provided man made banks higher than the natural banks . the michigan works progress administration described the bridge as having concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , that allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed . the manistique tourism council stated at one time , the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was atmospherically forced under it , and that the bridge has been featured in ripley s believe it or not . the eight span structure is feet m long . the cut river bridge carries us across the cut river in hendricks township , mackinac county . this structure was built during world war ii but completion was delayed due to war induced steel shortages . the span uses short tons long tons t of structural steel to bridge the feet m over the river and its gorge at a height of feet m above the river . the cut river bridge is one of only two cantilevered deck truss bridges in the state . on either side of the bridge , there are picnic areas and trails down to the river . listed on the nrhp on december , , the mackinac trail carp river bridge carries h , the modern successor to us , over the carp river north of st. ignace . the bridge is another spandrel arch structure feet m in length and built in . increasing traffic along mackinac trail prompted the mshd to widen its deck by five feet . m and install new guardrails in the biennium along with the addition of decorative retaining walls . the last of the historic bridges along a former segment of us is the structure carrying ashmun street bs i over the power canal in sault ste . marie . built in , it is one of only three steel arch bridges in the state . the foot wide m and foot long m structure is described by mdot as massive with an innovative construction method the previous structure was used as a falsework for the current bridge before removal . major intersections mdot has erected milemarkers along the two michigan segments of the highway that use the total mileage starting at the state line in ironwood the signs on the eastern segment reflect the mileage in florence county , wisconsin . business route business u.s. highway bus . us is a . mile . km business route that runs from the wisconsin state line at the montreal river . the route extends through downtown ironwood on silver and aurora streets before turning northward along suffolk street . bus . us stays on suffolk street for a short while until it turns onto frederick street . on frederick street , bus . us bears north through a residential area along douglas street . the eastern terminus of the route is at its junction with us at the corner of cloverland drive and douglas street north of downtown . the business route was created in august when former m in ironwood was renumbered as a business loop of us . it was originally a bi state business connection before the wisconsin department of transportation decommissioned bus . us in hurley westward along state trunk highway and northward along us in . butterfly world tour the butterfly world tour was the third concert tour by american singer songwriter mariah carey . the tour promoted carey s album at the time , butterfly , and included songs from several of her previous

john makes a cameo appearance during their joint performance of newton john s song , hopelessly devoted to you . the video was commercially successful , being certified platinum in the united states by the recording industry association of america riaa and gold in brazil by the associao brasileira dos produtores de discos abpd . background since her debut in , carey had not journeyed on a large or extensive tour . in fact , she had not embarked on a tour until her third studio effort , music box , when she performed six arena shows in the united states during the music box tour . the opening night of the tour received scathing reviews , mostly aimed at carey s deemed obvious stage fright and failure to make a connection with the crowd . succeeding nights were more favorably reviewed , with critics raving about carey s vocals . jon pareles of the new york times wrote regarding carey s live vocals , beyond any doubt , ms. carey s voice is no studio concoction . her range extends from a rich , husky alto to dog whistle high notes she can linger over sensual turns , growl with playful confidence , syncopate like a scat singer . however , after the strong media attention , carey did not visit the us on her succeeding daydream world tour in , visiting only europe and asia . the tour in contrast , received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike , as well as breaking ticket sale records . carey s three shows at japan s largest stadium , tokyo dome , sold out in under three hours , equaling in over , tickets , setting the record of fastest show sellouts in japan s history . on the butterfly world tour , carey broke the record , selling , tickets in under one hour . during , after the commercially and critically successful release of butterfly , carey had not planned to tour once again , due to the long travel times and strain on her voice . however , due to overwhelming demand by fans , carey agreed to perform in asia once again , only extending the tour to taiwan and australia , as well as one last show in the united states . rehearsals for the show began shortly after christmas , extending for a period of two weeks . concert synopsis the show began with carey standing on a small elevated centerpiece on stage , surrounded by several long draped curtains . carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour , trey lorenz , melodie daniels and kelly price . as the introduction began with emotions , each of the curtains were slowly draped , revealing carey atop the platform , dressed in a beige mini dress and matching sheer blouse and stiletto heels . as she began performing emotions , the platform was lowered so carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song s performance . after an intimate performance with dimmed lights for the roof back in time , carey was joined on stage by a peruvian guitar player , who played the latin inspired guitar melodies during her performance of my all . afterwards , carey sang close my eyes , the only sitting performance of the show . during the song , several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind carey on a higher level of the stage . for the second part of the show , carey had the second costume change of the evening , donning a long sequined black gown and semi teased hair . for the performance of dreamlover , carey was joined by three female back up dancers , who mimicked her light dance routines during the song . the next song on the set list was hero , which featured carey alone on stage , without any vocal back up . after the

the windmill is located at thelnetham , suffolk , england . it was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into flour . thelnetham windmill worked by wind power until , latterly on two sails , after which it became derelict . in , a group of enthusiasts purchased thelnetham windmill for restoration . numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight year period . the mill is open to the public , and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site . the mill is a small four storey tower mill with patent sails and winded by a fantail . it drives two pairs of millstones , with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine . history the windmill at thelnetham was built by millwright george bloomfield for william button in . it replaced a post mill which had been moved to sandy lane , diss , norfolk the previous year . the mill was set to work on christmas day . in , the mill was modernised by the fitting of a cast iron windshaft , patent sails and a fantail . the new windshaft was fitted on july . it was made by j aickman , the kings lynn millwright , and weighs tons , kg . a new stock was fitted in september . william button died on february . the mill passed jointly to his widow rebecca and their son richard . richard button worked the mill until , at which date it was conveyed to his sons richard and william , who sold it to richard peverett from kenninghall , norfolk in . the mill was worked by stephen peverett , richard s son . he inherited the mill on the death of his father in and leased it to henry bryant in . in , the mill was sold by auction , and henry bryant purchased the freehold . bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill . from , a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power , driving an extra pair of millstones on the ground floor . this was replaced in by a hornsby oil engine . bryant ran the mill until when he sold it to alphonso vincent , a retired millwright from garboldisham , norfolk . the hornsby engine was sold in the early s . the mill was tailwinded c , and as a result one pair of sails was removed . vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in . one of the remaining two sails was wrecked in when the mill was again tailwinded . on the death of alphonso vincent in , his son george inherited the property . he lived at the site in an old lorry until his death in . the mill passed to his daughter , who sold it in to mr and mrs humphries , who intended to convert it into a house . they later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration . in , the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale . thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the suffolk mills group in november , and plans for restoration were made . the consortium consisted of mark barnard , charles dolman , peter dolman , david pearce and chris seago . the derelict mill and an acre of land cost , . restoration the mill was restored over a period of six years . much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill . the consortium took possession of the mill in november . the first priority was to make the mill as weathertight as possible . polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure . the mill was surveyed and recorded . in spring , the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure . scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled , and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame . a two week work in was held at the end of july and beginning of august . thirty three volunteers worked on the mill over the work in . two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at bury st edmunds . on august , the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane , followed by the cap frame and the cast iron curb sections . new oak joists were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower . the bin floor was removed , apart from one oak main beam which was repairable . a replacement main beam was made from pitch pine , and the oak beam was repaired . new oak joists were fitted , along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused . one of these had previously been a whip from a common sail . some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the eastbridge windpump , which , following its collapse on february , had been re erected at the museum of east anglian life , stowmarket . the sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair , brickwork was repaired , and new lintels were made for some of the windows . a tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter . the floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed . the work was financed by grants of from the council for the preservation of rural essex , from st edmundsbury borough council , from the scarfe trust , and from the suffolk mills group . other donations and income amounted to , with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the five owners . the work in was reported in both local and national media , including bbc look east , bury free press , eastern daily press , east anglian daily times , daily telegraph , and radio orwell . in the season two separate work ins were held , the first from july to august and the second from august to august . a total of volunteers participated over the two weeks . the millstones were removed from the stone floor , which was then repaired . one of the main beams was found to have been attacked by death watch beetles , and over a third of the elm beam was replaced with oak . the six supports for the hurst frame were repaired one at a time , as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above . one post required replacement . it had rotted and the floor had sunk by inches mm causing the second main floor beam to fracture . when this work had been completed , the stone floor was removed , including the second main floor beam , which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed . the new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was concreted . the stone floor was reconstructed , reusing the old stone bearers and those joists that were fit for reuse . other joists were made new from oak or pitch pine . new floorboards were laid in the dust floor , the inches mm thick elm boards being double grooved with a metal tongue between them . those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration . the top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them , aided by a trammel attached to the upright shaft . during the second work in , the remainder of the stone floor was boarded , again using double grooved boards with a metal tongue between them . the window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued . the top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks . the dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted . the windshaft , the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint . a new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak feet mm long by inches mm diameter . a start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar . after the work in had finished , the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn . the work done in cost , . donations received were , from rank xerox , , from the historic buildings council and from st edmundsbury borough council . other donations and income received amounted to . the project received further coverage in local media , the eastern daily press , and south norfolk news . the work ins took place from july to august and august to august . the work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower , installation of the elm curb , a start on the construction of the new cap , installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows . the cap frame was constructed , incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused . the cap frame was completed in autumn . it had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position . work in the early part of was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various brasses and overhaul of the various parts of the fantail drivetrain and mechanism for controlling the patent sails . the mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits , including one from the wind and watermill section of the society for the protection of ancient buildings . other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the feet inches . m stones , including dismantling the stone nut and replacement of three cogs in beech . when the weather improved , work commenced outside . the cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work in commenced . the work ins took place over two separate weeks in july and august , with people participating . during the first work in , the fantail posts and braces were fitted . the oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting . intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass . the cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings . the rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time . between the two work ins , the rear dormer was completed and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed . this enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the monday of the second work in . the boards for the cap are inch mm thick and inches mm wide at the petticoat , tapering towards the top . a new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft , not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit . when the boarding of the cap was completed , the cover strips were fitted over the joints . the petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass , and the galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position , producing a sturdy structure . the striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts . at the top of the mill tower , the curb was prepared to accept the cap , and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position . repointing of the brickwork of the tower continued , with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work in . after the work ins had ended , work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift on in october . the weather hampered the work initially , but the application of a modern microporous paint , designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof , was completed in time for the lift on . a mini work in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted , with people participating over the weekend . final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill . the tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled . the ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on october , watched by a crowd of some people . the fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from adnams brewery , southwold . restoration work in cost , . grants were received from the association of independent museums , blo norton women s institute , ipswich historical transport society , the national association for gifted children , mr d. porter and the society for the protection of ancient buildings . further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by wilf foreman . four work ins were held during . the first two were by apprentices from eastern electricity board . thelnetham windmill was chosen at the project to benefit from the young person s development project for that year . pakenham watermill had previously benefited from the project , and its owners , the suffolk preservation trust , had suggested that thelnetham windmill would be a good candidate for the scheme . two separate parties spent a week each at the mill . a mains electricity supply was provided . an underground cable was laid with assistance from british telecom who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their research facility at martlesham heath . the thrust borer laid yards m of ducting through which the mains cable was pulled into position . the mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor . other work undertaken by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position . a concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture , leading to rising damp . a french drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem . a horsepower kw ruston hornsby yhr diesel engine had been purchased in and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane . after fitting it was then painted . some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary . off site , the new brake wheel and fantail were made . the original brake wheel was too rotten to repair , and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in . the original brake wheel was feet . m diameter to allow the common sails to run at their optimum speed . when the mill was modernised in it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as patent sails run at a slower speed than common sails . the great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter . the brake wheel was also rebuilt , with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs , resulting in a wheel feet inches . m in diameter . the opinion of professional millwrights was sought , and it was decided that a scaled up version of the original brake wheel would be made , but retaining the cast iron teeth segments . the remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill . the original iron segments were all broken , so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat treated malleable cast iron . when the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly . the fantail was made . some of the small gears were replaced . the stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from douglas fir . work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows , with only one window still needing attention when the first work in began . new beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel , which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft . the stocks and sails were made during the two work ins held in july and august , a total of people attending over the two weeks . a second hand stock had been bought in the s and preserved at the mill , but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use . thus two new stocks were required instead of one . modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds , leaving two options . traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber , or laminated stocks . good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required . douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds . a douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years . thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made . the feet . m long stocks were made from douglas fir . all timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned . it was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to stronger than a similar stock of solid timber . the timber used was inches mm thick and nine laminations were required at the centre , where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft . careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber . both stocks were made during the work in , with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use . the stocks were the first laminated stocks made by amateurs . the four sails were made . the originals being slightly different pairs . those on the inner stock having bays of feet mm pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of feet inches mm pitch . it was decided that the new sails would be identical , at the larger pitch . four feet . m long whips were cut from a baulk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished maltings at bury st edmunds . the whips are inches mm square at their inner end . sail bars and uplongs were made from modern pitch pine , selected for quality . the mortices for the sail bars were cut . that at the heel of the sail being at and that at the tip being , decreasing by at each sail bar . three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in . the fantail and associated gearing was fitted to the mill . at the end of the second work in , the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank . the fantail itself , with the blades painted red , white and blue was installed shortly afterwards . the clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft . it was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by inch mm . when this was corrected the brake wheel was within th of an inch less than mm of true . the clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year . other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors , cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork . the four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work in . the stock , with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock . the process was repeated for the second pair of sails . the mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work in . work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail , balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail gearing . the brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast . restoration work in cost , . grants received were , from english heritage , from st edmundsbury borough council , other donations amounted to . income from open days at the mill came to . a boost to the funds was , from hervey benham . this money had been allocated to allow the moving of a derelict post mill buck to thelnetham . in the end , the removal was not proceeded with , and mr benham allowed the donation to remain with the thelnetham mill preservation trust . the project received further support in local media , including the east anglian daily times , one of the work ins being featured on anglia television s about anglia programme . work planned for included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails . the external walls of the mill were tarred and internal walls plastered . two work ins were held , from july to july and august to august . further work over the next two years saw the restoration completed in . restoration team the restoration of thelnetham windmill was made possible by the efforts of individuals and organisations . this was achieved by the donation of labour , plant , materials or grants of money , or by giving discounts for materials purchased or providing publicity for the project . description terms explained in the mill machinery article are in italics as built in a four storey tower mill with common sails carried on a wooden windshaft ,

sailor mouth was directed by andrew overtoom , and was written by walt dohrn , paul tibbitt , and merriwether williams . dohrn and tibbitt also served as storyboard directors , and carson kugler , william reiss and erik wiese worked as storyboard artists . series creator stephen hillenburg has described the episode plot as a classic thing all kids go through . much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers own experiences from childhood . the episode originally aired on nickelodeon in the united states on september , . the episode marks the introduction of mr. krabs mother , mama krabs , who was voiced by former spongebob squarepants creative producer and current executive producer paul tibbitt . the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode . the idea for sailor mouth was inspired by creative director derek drymon s experience when i got in trouble for saying the f word in front of my mother . drymon said , the scene where patrick is running to mr. krabs to tattle , with spongebob chasing him , is pretty much how it happened in real life . the end of the episode , where mr. krabs uses more profanity than spongebob and patrick , was also inspired by the fact that my drymon s mother has a sailor mouth herself . the scene where spongebob and patrick playing a game of eels and escalators , which is a parody of snakes and ladders , was difficult for the crew to animate , since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location . according to the series season dvd commentary , it was planned to have a scene that had spongebob saying go dolphin noise yourself followed by patrick saying dolphin noise you too during the eels and escalators game . it was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience . sailor mouth was released on the dvd compilation called spongebob squarepants sea stories on march , . it was also included in the spongebob squarepants the complete nd season dvd released on october , . on september , , sailor mouth was released on the spongebob squarepants the first episodes , alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five . reception erik wiese , a member of the spongebob squarepants crew , considers sailor mouth to be his favorite episode , mainly due to its random and satirical nature , saying sometimes spongebob just catches me off guard . nancy basile of about.com ranked the episode at number two for her list of the top spongebob squarepants episodes . she said sailor mouth just barely missed being in the number one slot . basile praised the episode s plot and called it genius ... because children can relate to the forbidden thrill of using curse words , and adults can laugh at the parody of tv censorship . in an interview with paul tibbitt , one of the episode s writers , he told that sailor mouth is his second favorite spongebob episode . criticism and controversy according to a report titled wolves in sheep s clothing , which documents the increase in potentially violent , profane , and sexual content in children s programming , the parents television council , a watchdog media group , and fans believed the spongebob squarepants episode sailor mouth was an implicit attempt to promote and satirize use of profanity among children . the episode originally aired during the television season , ironically the season in which the ptc named spongebob squarepants among the best programs on cable television , but the report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from to prove its point that it promoted use of profanity among children . in a later report , several members of the ptc listed sailor mouth as an example of how levels of profane , sexual , and violent activity has increased in children s television programming . nickelodeon , in response to the incident , said it s sad and a little desperate that they stooped to literally putting profane language in the mouths of our characters to make a point . has the fcc looked at this richard huff of the new york daily news criticized the report for misinterpreting an episode of spongebob squarepants , sailor mouth , over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly . military history of australia the military history of australia spans the nation s year modern history , from the early australian frontier wars between aboriginals and europeans to the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan in the early st century . although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences on australian society and national identity , including the anzac spirit . the relationship between war and australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma . as british offshoots , the australian colonies participated in britain s small wars of the th century , while later as a federated dominion , and then an independent nation , australia fought in the first world war and second world war , as well as in the wars in korea , malaya , borneo and vietnam during the cold war . in the post vietnam era australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions , through the united nations and other agencies , including in the sinai , persian gulf , rwanda , somalia , east timor and the solomon islands , while more recently they have also fought as part of multi lateral forces in iraq and afghanistan . in total , nearly , australians died during the course of these conflicts . war and australian society for most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white australian males , and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the th century , it continues to influence australian society to this day . war and military service have been defining influences in australian history , while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the australian experience of war and of soldiering , known as the anzac spirit . these ideals include notions of endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , larrikinism , egalitarianism and mateship traits which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour of australian soldiers fighting at gallipoli during the first world war . the gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw australians taking part as australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity . the relationship between war and australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of australian strategic culture bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare . indeed , australian defence policy was closely linked to britain until the japanese crisis of , while since then an alliance with the united states has underwritten its security . arguably , this pattern of bandwagoning both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more pragmatic security concerns has ensured that australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies . regardless , a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident , with australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges . reflecting both the realist and liberal paradigms of international relations and the conception of national interests , a number of other important themes in australian strategic culture are also obvious . such themes include an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics , the centrality of notions of westphalian sovereignty , a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security , and the proposition that the status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully . likewise , multilateralism , collective security and defence self reliance have also been important themes . change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history , being the product of australian society s democratic political tradition and judaeo christian anglo european heritage , as well its associated values , beliefs and economic , political and religious ideology . these behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely european island on the edge of the asia pacific , and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power . to be sure , during threats to the core australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved in foreign wars . throughout these conflicts australian soldiers known colloquially as diggers have often been noted , somewhat paradoxically , for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities . colonial era british forces in australia , from until the defence of the australian colonies was mostly provided by british army regular forces . originally marines protected the early settlements at sydney cove and norfolk island , however they were relieved of these duties in by a british army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the new south wales corps . the new south wales corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of irish convicts at castle hill in . soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the war office of the need for a more reliable garrison in new south wales and van diemen s land . chief of these shortcomings was the rum rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in . as a result , in january the rd perthshire regiment of foot arrived in australia . by , british infantry regiments had served in australia , as had a small number of artillery and engineer units . although the primary role of the british army was to protect the colonies against external attack , no actual threat ever materialised . the british army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , combating bushranging , putting down convict rebellions as occurred at bathurst in and to suppress aboriginal resistance to the extension of european settlement . notably british soldiers were involved in the battle at the eureka stockade in on the victorian goldfields . members of british regiments stationed in australia also saw action in india , afghanistan , new zealand and the sudan . during the early years of settlement the naval defence of australia was provided by detached royal navy units of the east indies station , based in sydney . however , in australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore , marking the first occasion that royal navy ships had been permanently stationed in australia . the royal navy remained the primary naval force in australian waters until , when the australia station ceased and responsibility handed over to the royal australian navy the royal navy s depots , dockyards and structures were given to the australian people . frontier warfare , the reactions of the native aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of british settlers in australia were varied , but were inevitably hostile when the settler s presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants lands . european diseases decimated aboriginal populations , and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation . by and large neither the british nor the aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare . at times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement of british soldiers and later mounted police units . not all aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands , while many aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes . fighting between aborigines and europeans was localised as the aborigines did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance . as a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent . organised or disorganised however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with aboriginal resistance beginning in the th century and continuing into the early th century . this warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic myth of peaceful settlement in australia . faced with aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres . among the most famous is the battle of pinjarra in western australia in . such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the myall creek massacre in new south wales in seven europeans were hanged for their part in the killings . however , in tasmania the so called black war was fought between and , and aimed at driving most of the island s native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas . although it began in failure for the british , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population . it may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by europeans on aborigines . although many more aborigines died than british , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the europeans . aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre existing hunting and fighting practices using spears , clubs and other primitive weapons . unlike the indigenous peoples of new zealand and north america , on the main aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the europeans . although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not widespread . the aborigines were never a serious military threat to european settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them . on occasions large groups of aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage . this could sometimes be effective , with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents , waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded . however , such open warfare usually proved more costly for the aborigines than the europeans . central to the success of the europeans was the use of firearms . however , the advantages afforded by firearms have often been overstated . prior to the late th century , firearms were often cumbersome muzzle loading , smooth bore , single shot muskets with flint lock mechanisms . such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within metres ft . these deficiencies may have initially given the aborigines an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with spears or clubs . yet by significant advances in firearms gave the europeans a distinct advantage , with the six shot colt revolver , the snider single shot breech loading rifle and later the martini henry rifle , as well as rapid fire rifles such as the winchester rifle , becoming available . these weapons , when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of aborigines , often proved successful . the europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast moving , often hidden enemies . tactics employed included night time surprise attacks , and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks . the conflict lasted for over years and followed the pattern of british settlement in australia . beginning in new south wales with the arrival of the first europeans in may , it continued in sydney and its surrounds until the s . as the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback new south wales in the s . in tasmania , fighting can be traced from to the s , while in victoria and the southern parts of south australia , the majority of the violence occurred during the s and s . the south west of western australia experienced warfare from to . the war in queensland began in the area around brisbane in the s and continued until , moving to central queensland in the s and s , and then to northern queensland from the s to . in western australia , the violence moved north with european settlement , reaching the kimberley region by , with violent clashes continuing until the s . in the northern territory conflict lasted even later still , especially in central australia , continuing from the s to the s . one estimate of casualties places european deaths at , , while at least , aborigines are believed to have perished . far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the aboriginal population by the beginning of the th century a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist . new zealand wars , taranaki war in , the victorian ship hmcss victoria was dispatched to help the new zealand colonial government in its war against mori in taranaki . victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support , although a number of personnel were involved in actions against mori fortifications . one sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment . invasion of the waikato in late , the new zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the waikato province against the mori . promised settlement on confiscated land , more than , australians over half of whom were from victoria were recruited to form four waikato regiments . other australians became scouts in the company of forest rangers . despite experiencing arduous conditions the australians were not heavily involved in battle , and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties . australians were involved in actions at matarikoriko , pukekohe east , titi hill , rkau and te ranga . fewer than were believed to have been killed in action . the conflict was over by , and the waikato regiments disbanded in . however , many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade , while many others had returned to australia . colonial military forces , from until , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence . the colonies had gained responsible government between and , and while the colonial office in london retained control of some affairs , the governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia . to do this , they were granted the authority from the british crown to raise military and naval forces . initially these were militias in support of british regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities . the colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component . they were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline . even after significant reforms in the s including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense . by , the forces numbered , men . although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the british empire during the th century , with the colonies raising contingents to serve in sudan , south africa and china . despite a reputation of colonial inferiority , many of the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained . during this period , defences in australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts . however , by the s , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led major general james edwards who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry . as a consequence he called for a restructure of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies . edwards argued for the colonial forces to be federated and for professional units obliged to serve anywhere in the south pacific to replace the volunteer forces . these views found support in the influential new south wales commandant , major general edward hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards new south wales and victoria stifled the proposal . these reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies . with the exception of western australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . in , victoria received its own naval vessel , hmcss victoria , and its deployment to new zealand in during the first taranaki war marked the first occasion that an australian warship had been deployed overseas . the colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad hmvs cerberus in service from , as well as the steam sail warship hms nelson on loan from the royal navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo boats . new south wales formed a naval brigade in and by the start of the th century had two small torpedo boats and a corvette . the queensland maritime defence force was established in , while south australia operated a single ship , hmcs protector . tasmania had also a small torpedo corps , while western australia s only naval defences included the fremantle naval artillery . naval personnel from new south wales and victoria took part in the suppression of the boxer rebellion in china in , while hmcs protector was sent by south australia but saw no action . the separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until federation in , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new commonwealth of australia . sudan , during the early years of the s , an egyptian regime in the sudan , backed by the british , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native muhammad ahmad or ahmed , known as mahdi to his followers . in , as part of the mahdist war , the egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces . the british instructed the egyptians to abandon the sudan , and sent general charles gordon to co ordinate the evacuation , but he was killed in january . when news of his death arrived in new south wales in february , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent s expenses . the new south wales contingent consisted of an infantry battalion of men and officers , and an artillery battery of men and sailed from sydney on march . the contingent arrived in suakin on march and were attached to a brigade that consisted of scots , grenadier and coldstream guards . they subsequently marched for tamai in a large square formation made up of , men . reaching the village , they burned huts and returned to suakin three australians were wounded in minor fighting . most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards berber , on the nile . the australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a camel corps was raised and men volunteered . they rode on a reconnaissance to takdul on may and were heavily involved in a skirmish during which more than arabs were killed or captured . on may , they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous march . meanwhile , the artillery were posted at handoub and drilled for a month , but they soon rejoined the camp at suakin . eventually the british government decided that the campaign in sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in suakin . the new south wales contingent sailed for home on may , arriving in sydney on june . approximately australians served in sudan nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign . second boer war , british encroachment into areas of south africa already settled by the afrikaner boers and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result , led to the second boer war in . pre empting the deployment of british forces , the afrikaner republics of the orange free state and the transvaal republic under president paul kruger declared war on october , striking deep into the british territories of natal and the cape colony . after the outbreak of war , plans for the dispatch of a combined australian force were subsequently set aside by the british war office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate contingents to serve with british formations , with two squadrons each of men from new south wales and victoria , and one each from the other colonies . the first troops arrived three weeks later , with the new south wales lancers who had been training in england before the war , hurriedly diverted to south africa . on november , the lancers came under fire for the first time near belmont , and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them . following a series of minor victories , the british suffered a major setback during black week between december , although no australian units were involved . the first contingents of infantry from victoria , south australia , western australia , and tasmania arrived in cape town on november and were designated the australian regiment under the command of colonel john charles hoad . with a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry . further units from queensland and new south wales arrived in december and were soon committed to the front . the first casualties occurred soon after at sunnyside on january , after queensland mounted infantry and a column of canadians , british and artillery attacked a boer laager at belmont . troopers david mcleod and victor jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the boer forward sentries . regardless , the boers were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting , more than were killed and another taken prisoner . five hundred queenslanders and the new south wales lancers subsequently took part in the siege of kimberley in february . despite serious set backs at colenso , stormberg , magersfontein , and spion kop in january and with ladysmith still under siege the british mounted a five division counter invasion of the orange free state in february . the attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by lieutenant general john french with the new south wales lancers , queensland mounted infantry and new south wales army medical corps attached . first , kimberley was relieved following the battles of modder river and magersfontein , and the retreating boers defeated at paardeberg , with the new south wales mounted rifles locating the boer general , piet cronj . the british entered bloemfontein on march , while ladysmith was relieved . disease began to take its toll and scores of men died . still the advance continued , with the drive to pretoria in may including more than , australians . johannesburg fell on may , and the boers withdrew from pretoria on june . the new south wales mounted rifles and western australians saw action again at diamond hill on june . mafeking was relieved on may . following the defeat of the afrikaner republics still the boers held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt british troop movements and lines of supply . this new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the australian colonies and the raising of the bushmen s contingents , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse riding and shooting skills , but little military experience . after federation in , eight australian commonwealth horse battalions of the newly created australian army were also sent to south africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended . some australians later joined local south african irregular units , instead of returning home after discharge . these soldiers were part of the british army , and were subject to british military discipline . such units included the bushveldt carbineers which gained notoriety as the unit in which harry breaker morant and peter handcock served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes . with the guerrillas requiring supplies , koos de la rey lead a force of , boers against brakfontein , on the elands river in western transvaal . the post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by australians and rhodesians . the attack began on august with heavy shelling causing casualties . during the night the defenders dug in , enduring shelling and rifle fire . a relief force was stopped by the boers , while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved . the siege lasted days , during which more than , shells were fired into the post . after calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders , and not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the boers eventually retired . the siege of elands river was one of the major achievements of the australians during the war , with the post finally relieved on august . in response the british adopted counter insurgency tactics , including a scorched earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops , the establishment of concentration camps for boer women and children , and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit boer mobility and to protect railway communications . such measures required considerable expenditure , and caused much bitterness towards the british , however they soon yielded results . by mid , the bulk of the fighting was over , and british mounted units would ride at night to attack boer farmhouses or encampments , overwhelming them with superior numbers . indicative of warfare in last months of , the new south wales mounted rifles travelled , miles , km and were involved in skirmishes , killing boers , wounding , and capturing for the loss of five dead and wounded . other notable australian actions included slingersfontein , pink hill , rhenosterkop and haartebeestefontein . australians were not always successful however , suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war . on june , the th victorian mounted rifles lost killed and wounded at wilmansrust , near middleburg after poor security allowed a force of boers to surprise them . on october , victorians of the scottish horse regiment also suffered heavy casualties at gun hill , although boers were also killed in the engagement . meanwhile , at onverwacht on january , the th queensland imperial bushmen lost killed and wounded . ultimately the boers were defeated , and the war ended on may . in all , australians served in south africa , and perhaps another , enlisted as individuals in imperial units casualties included killed in action , died of disease and missing in action , while a further were wounded . six australians were awarded the victoria cross . boxer rebellion , the boxer rebellion in china began in , and a number of western nations including many european powers , the united states , and japan soon sent forces as part of the china field force to protect their interests . in june , the british government sought permission from the australian colonies to dispatch ships from the australian squadron to china . the colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in south africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower . the force dispatched was a modest one , with britain accepting men from victoria , from new south wales and the south australian ship hmcs protector , under the command of captain william creswell . most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists , who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role . amongst the naval contingent from new south wales were naval officers and sailors and permanent soldiers headquartered at victoria barracks , sydney who originally enlisted for the second boer war . the soldiers were keen to go to china but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the new south wales naval brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks . the army and navy compromised and titled the contingent the nsw marine light infantry . the contingents from new south wales and victoria sailed for china on august . arriving in tientsin , the australians provided men to an , strong multinational force tasked with capturing the chinese forts at pei tang , which dominated a key railway . they arrived too late to take part in the battle , but were involved in the attack on the fortress at pao ting fu , where the chinese government was believed to have found asylum after peking was captured by western forces . the victorians joined a force of , men on a ten day march to the fort , once again only to find that it had already surrendered . the victorians then garrisoned tientsin and the new south wales contingent undertook garrison duties in peking . hmcs protector was mostly used for survey , transport , and courier duties in the gulf of chihli , before departing in november . the naval brigades remained during the winter , unhappily performing policing and guard duties , as well as working as railwaymen and fire fighters . they left china in march , having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order . six australians died from sickness and injury , but none were killed as a result of enemy action . australian military forces at federation , the commonwealth of australia came into existence on january as a result of the federation of the australian colonies . under the constitution of australia , defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government . the co ordination of australia wide defensive efforts in the face of imperial german interest in the pacific ocean was one of driving forces behind federalism , and the department of defence immediately came into being as a result , while the commonwealth military forces early forerunner of the australian army and commonwealth naval force were also soon established . the australian commonwealth military forces came into being on march and all the colonial forces including those still in south africa became part of the new force . , colonial soldiers , including , professional soldiers , , paid militia and , unpaid volunteers , were subsequently transferred . the individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial acts until the defence act brought all the units under one piece of legislation . this act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside australia . however , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the citizen military forces cmf . major general sir edward hutton a former commander of the new south wales military forces subsequently became the first commander of the commonwealth military forces on december and set to work devising an integrated structure for the new army . in , following a report by lord kitchener the royal military college , duntroon was established , as was a system of universal national service . prior to federation each self governing colony had operated its own naval force . these navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to subsidise the cost of a british naval squadron in their waters for decades . the colonies maintained control over their respective navies until march , when the commonwealth naval force was created . this new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in australian naval policy . in prime minister alfred deakin and creswell , while attending the imperial conference in london , sought the british government s agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an australian navy . the admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient . deakin was unimpressed , and in invited the american great white fleet to visit australia . this visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two ton river class destroyers . the surge in german naval construction prompted the admiralty to change their position however and the royal australian navy was subsequently formed in , absorbing the commonwealth naval force . on october , the new fleet steamed through sydney heads , consisting of the battlecruiser hmas australia , three light cruisers , and three destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction . and as a consequence the navy entered the first world war as a formidable force . the australian flying corps afc was established as part of the commonwealth military forces in , prior to the formation of the australian military forces in and was later separated in to form the royal australian air force , making it the second oldest air force in the world . regardless , the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however , and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments . first world war , outbreak of hostilities when britain declared war on germany at the start of the first world war , the australian government rapidly followed suit , with prime minister joseph cook declaring on august that ... when the empire is at war , so also is australia and reflecting the sentiment of many australians that any declaration of war by britain automatically included australia . this was itself in part due to the large number of british born citizens and first generation anglo australians that made up the australian population at the time . indeed , by the end of the war almost of those who served in the australian forces had been born in britain . as the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the defence act , an all volunteer expeditionary force known as the australian imperial force aif was formed and recruitment began on august . the government pledged , men , organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units . enlistment and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under mobilisation plans drawn up in . the first commander was major general william bridges , who also assumed command of the st division . throughout the course of the conflict australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war , although small air and naval forces were also committed . occupation of german new guinea following the outbreak of war australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of germany s pacific colonies . the australian naval and military expeditionary force an mef , a man volunteer force separate from the aif and consisting of an infantry battalion plus naval reservists and ex sailors , was rapidly formed under the command of william holmes . the objectives of the force were the wireless stations on nauru , and those at yap in the caroline islands , and at rabaul in german new guinea . the force reached rabaul on september and occupied it the next day , encountering only brief resistance from the german and native defenders during fighting at bita paka and toma . german new guinea surrendered on september . australian losses were light , including six killed during the fighting , but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine ae with all men aboard . gallipoli the aif departed by ship in a single convoy from albany on november . during the journey one of the convoy s naval escorts hmas sydney engaged and destroyed the german cruiser sms emden at the battle of cocos on november , in the first ship to ship action involving the royal australian navy . although originally bound for england to undergo further training and then for employment on the western front , the australians were instead sent to british controlled egypt to pre empt any turkish attack against the strategically important suez canal , and with a view to opening another front against the central powers . aiming to knock turkey out of the war the british then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the australians were included amongst the british , indian and french forces committed to the campaign . the combined australian and new zealand army corps anzac commanded by british general william birdwood subsequently landed at anzac cove on the gallipoli peninsula on april . although promising to transform the war if successful , the gallipoli campaign was ill conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives . australian casualties totalled , , including , killed . for australians and new zealanders the gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity . today , the date of the initial landings , april , is known as anzac day in australia and new zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations , as well as turkey , to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original anzacs , and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war . egypt and palestine after the withdrawal from gallipoli the australians returned to egypt and the aif underwent a major expansion . in the infantry began to move to france while the cavalry units remained in the middle east to fight the turks . australian troops of the anzac mounted division and the australian mounted division saw action in all the major battles of the sinai and palestine campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the turkish troops that were threatening british control of egypt . the australian s first saw combat during the senussi uprising in the libyan desert and the nile valley , during which the combined british forces successfully put down the primitive pro turkish islamic sect with heavy casualties . the anzac mounted division subsequently saw considerable action in the battle of romani against the turkish between august , with the turks eventually pushed back . following this victory the british forces went on the offensive in the sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the suez canal . rafa was captured on january , while the last of the small turkish garrisons in the sinai were eliminated in february . the advance entered palestine and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made to capture gaza on march , while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on april . a third assault occurred between october and november and this time both the anzac mounted division and the australian mounted division took part . the battle was a complete success for the british , over running the gaza beersheba line and capturing , turkish soldiers . the critical moment was the capture of beersheba on the first day , after the australian th light horse brigade charged more than miles . km . the turkish trenches were overrun , with the australians capturing the wells at beersheeba and securing the valuable water they contained along with over prisoners for the loss of killed and wounded . later , australian troops assisted in pushing the turkish forces out of palestine and took part in actions at mughar ridge , jerusalem and the megiddo . the turkish government surrendered on october . units of the light horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in egypt in and did so with efficiency and brutality , although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process . meanwhile , the afc had undergone remarkable development , and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the dominions . deploying just a single aircraft to german new guinea in , the first operational flight did not occur until may however , when the mesopotamian half flight was called upon to assist in protecting british oil interests in iraq . the afc was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in egypt , palestine and on the western front , where they performed well . western front five infantry divisions of the aif saw action in france and belgium , leaving egypt in march . i anzac corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of armentires on april and for the next two and a half years the aif participated in most of the major battles on the western front , earning a formidable reputation . although spared from the disastrous first day of the battle of the somme , within weeks four australian divisions had been committed . the th division , positioned on the left flank , was the first in action during the battle of fromelles on july , suffering , casualties in a single day . the st division entered the line on july , assaulting pozieres , and by the time that they were relieved by the nd division on july , they had suffered , casualties . mouquet farm was attacked in august , with casualties totalling , men . by the time the aif was withdrawn from the somme to re organise , they had suffered , casualties in just days . in march , the nd and th divisions pursued the germans back to the hindenburg line , capturing the town of bapaume . on april , the th division assaulted the hindenburg line in the disastrous first battle of bullecourt , losing over , casualties and , captured . on april , the st and nd divisions were counter attacked near lagnicourt and were forced to abandon the town , before recapturing it again . the nd division then took part in the second battle of bullecourt , beginning on may , and succeeded in taking sections of the hindenburg line and holding them until relieved by the st division . finally , on may the th division relieved the st , remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid may . combined these efforts cost , australian casualties . on june , the ii anzac corps along with two british corps launched an operation in flanders to eliminate a salient south of ypres . the attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds , kg of explosives that had been placed underneath the messines ridge , destroying the german trenches . the advance was virtually unopposed , and despite strong german counterattacks the next day , it succeeded . australian casualties during the battle of messines included nearly , men . i anzac corps then took part in the third battle of ypres in belgium as part of the campaign to capture the gheluvelt plateau , between september and november . individual actions took place at menin road , polygon wood , broodseinde , poelcappelle and passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the australians suffered , casualties . on march the german army launched its spring offensive in a last ditched effort to win the war , unleashing sixty three divisions over a miles km front . as the allies fell back the rd and th divisions were rushed south to amiens on the somme . the offensive lasted for the next five months and all five aif divisions in france were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide . by late may the germans had pushed to within miles km of paris . during this time the australians fought at dernacourt , morlancourt , villers bretonneux , hangard wood , hazebrouck , and hamel . at hamel the commander of the australian corps , lieutenant general john monash , successfully used combined arms including aircraft , artillery and armour in an attack for the first time . the german offensive ground to a halt in mid july and a brief lull followed , during which the australians undertook a series of raids , known as peaceful penetrations . the allies soon launched their own offensive the hundred days offensive ultimately ending the war . beginning on august the offensive included four australian divisions striking at amiens . using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at hamel , significant gains were made on what became known as the black day of the german army . the offensive continued for four months , and during second battle of the somme the australian corps fought actions at lihons , etinehem , proyart , chuignes , and mont st quentin , before their final engagement of the war on october at montbrehain . the aif was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on november . in all , australians enlisted in the aif during the war and , served overseas . , were killed and another , were wounded a total casualty rate of . the financial cost to the australian government was calculated at , , . two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the australian force , but stretching the reserves of manpower available , particularly towards the end of the fighting . consequently , australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war . the war had a profound effect on australian society in other ways also . indeed , for many australians the nation s involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor , while many of the notions of australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war . australians were awarded the victoria cross during the first world war . inter war years russian civil war , the russian civil war began after the russian provisional government collapsed and the bolshevik party assumed power in october . following the end of the first world war , the western powers including britain intervened , giving half hearted support to the pro tsarist , anti bolshevik white russian forces . although the australian government refused to commit forces , many australians serving with the british army became involved in the fighting . a small number served as advisors to white russian units with the north russian expeditionary force nref . awaiting repatriation in england , about australians subsequently enlisted in the british north russia relief force nrrf , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed . the royal australian navy destroyer hmas swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the black sea in late . other australians served as advisers with the british military mission to the white russian general , anton denikin in south russia , while several more advised admiral aleksandr kolchak in siberia . later , they also served in mesopotamia as part of dunsterforce and the malleson mission , although these missions were aimed at preventing turkish access to the middle east and india , and did little fighting . although the motivations of those australian s that volunteered to fight in russia can only be guessed at , it seems unlikely to have been political . regardless , they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage , winning the only two victoria crosses of the land campaign , despite their small numbers . yet australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war . total casualties included killed and wounded , with most deaths being from disease during operations in mesopotamia . malaita , in october , hmas adelaide was called to the british solomon islands protectorate as part of a punitive expedition in response to the killing of a district officer and sixteen others by kwaio natives at sinalagu on the island of malaita on october , known as the malaita massacre . arriving at tulagi on october , the ship proceeded to malaita to protect the landing of three platoons of troops , then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the killers . the ship s personnel took no part in operations ashore , providing only logistic and communications support . adelaide returned to australia on november . spanish civil war , a small number of australian volunteers fought on both sides of the spanish civil war , although they predominantly supported the spanish republic through the international brigades . the australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other nationalities , such as the british battalion and the lincoln battalion , rather than forming their own units . most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons , while a number were spanish born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin . at least australians volunteered , with only one nugent bull , a conservative catholic who was later killed serving in the raf during the second world war known to have fought for general francisco franco s nationalist forces . while a celebrated cause for the australian left particularly the communist party of australia and the trade union movement the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality . australian opposition to the republican cause was marshalled by b.a. santamaria on an anti communist basis , rather than a pro nationalist basis . equally , although individual right wing australians may have served with the nationalist rebels , they received no public support . service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time , however as the government received no reports of australians travelling to spain to enlist , no action was taken . consequently , returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the returned and services league of australia rsl . although the number of australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least were killed . second world war , europe and the middle east australia entered the second world war on september . at the time of the declaration of war against germany the australian military was small and unready for war . recruiting for a second australian imperial force nd aif began in mid september . while there was no rush of volunteers like the first world war , a high proportion of australian men of military age had enlisted by mid . four infantry divisions were formed during and , three of which were dispatched to the middle east . the raaf s resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the commonwealth air forces through the empire air training scheme eats , through which almost , australians were trained during the war . the australian military s first major engagements of the war were against italian forces in the mediterranean and north africa . during the light cruiser hmas sydney and five elderly destroyers dubbed the scrap iron flotilla by nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels a title proudly accepted by the ships took part in a series of operations as part of the british mediterranean fleet , and sank several italian warships . the army first saw action in january , when the th division formed part of the commonwealth forces during operation compass . the division assaulted and captured bardia on january and tobruk on january , with tens of thousands of italian troops surrendering at both towns . the th division took part in the pursuit of the italian army and captured benghazi on february . in late february it was withdrawn for service in greece , and was replaced by the th division . the australian forces in the mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during . during april , the th division , other elements of i corps and several australian warships formed part of the allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend greece from german invasion during the battle of greece . at the end of this campaign , the th division was evacuated to egypt and crete . the force at crete subsequently fought in the battle of crete during may , which also ended in defeat for the allies . over , australians were captured in these campaigns , and the th division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat . the germans and italians also went on the offensive in north africa at the end of march and drove the commonwealth force there back to near the border with egypt . the th division and a brigade of the th division were besieged at tobruk successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by british units in october . during june , the main body of the th division , a brigade of the th division and the i corps headquarters took part in the syria lebanon campaign against the vichy french . resistance was stronger than expected australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the french capitulated in early july . the majority of australian units in the mediterranean returned to australia in early , after the outbreak of the pacific war . the th division was the largest unit to remain in the middle east , and played a key role in the first battle of el alamein during june and the second battle of el alamein in october . the division returned to australia in early , but several raaf squadrons and ran warships took part in the subsequent tunisia campaign and the italian campaign from until the end of the war . the raaf s role in the strategic air offensive in europe formed australia s main contribution to the defeat of germany . approximately , australian airmen served in dozens of british and five australian squadrons in raf bomber command between and the end of the war . australians took part in all of bomber command s major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on german cities and targets in france . australian aircrew in bomber command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the australian military during the second world war and sustained almost percent of all australian deaths in combat , were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner . australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of western europe during and and two raaf maritime patrol squadrons served in the battle of the atlantic . asia and the pacific from the s australia s defence thinking was dominated by british imperial defence policy , which was embodied by the singapore strategy . this strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at singapore from which a large british fleet would respond to japanese aggression in the region . to this end , a high proportion of australian forces in asia were concentrated in malaya during and as the threat from japan increased . however , as a result of the emphasis on co operation with britain , relatively few australian military units had been retained in australia and the asia pacific region . measures were taken to improve australia s defences as war with japan loomed in , but these proved inadequate . in december , the australian army in the pacific comprised the th division , most of which was stationed in malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in australia . the raaf was equipped with aircraft , most of which were obsolete trainers , and the ran had three cruisers and two destroyers in australian waters . the australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the pacific war . the th division and raaf squadrons in malaya formed a part of the british commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller japanese invasion force which landed on december . the british commonwealth force withdrew to singapore at the end of january , but was forced to surrender on february after the japanese captured much of the island . smaller australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early at rabaul , and in ambon , timor , and java . the australian town of darwin was heavily bombed by the japanese on february , to prevent it from being used as an allied base . over , australians were taken prisoner in early and endured harsh conditions in japanese captivity . the prisoners were subjected to malnutrition , denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards . as a result , , australian prisoners died in captivity . the rapid allied defeat in the pacific caused many australians to fear that the japanese would invade the australian mainland . while elements of the imperial japanese navy proposed this in early , it was judged to be impossible by the japanese imperial general headquarters , which instead adopted a strategy of isolating australia from the united states by capturing new guinea , the solomon islands , fiji , samoa , and new caledonia . this fact was not known by the allies at the time , and the australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion . large numbers of united states army and army air forces units arrived in australia in early , and the australian military was placed under the overall command of general douglas macarthur in march . australians played a central role in the new guinea campaign during and . after an attempt to land troops at port moresby was defeated in the battle of the coral sea , the japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the owen stanley ranges and milne bay . australian army units defeated these offensives in the kokoda track campaign and battle of milne bay with the support of the raaf and usaaf . australian and us army units subsequently assaulted and captured the japanese bases on the north coast of papua in the hard fought battle of buna gona . the australian army also defeated a japanese attempt to capture the town of wau in january and went onto the offensive in the salamaua lae campaign in april . in late , the th and th divisions played an important role in operation cartwheel , when they landed to the east and west of lae and secured the huon peninsula during the huon peninsula campaign and finisterre range campaign . the australian mainland came under attack during and . japanese submarines operated off australia from may to august and january to june . these attacks sought to cut the allied supply lines between australia and the us and australia and new guinea , but were unsuccessful . japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against allied bases in northern australia which were being used to mount the north western area campaign against japanese positions in the netherlands east indies nei . australia s role in the pacific war declined from . the increasing size of the us forces in the pacific rendered the australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production . nevertheless , the government wanted the australian military to remain active , and agreed to macarthur s proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns . in late , australian troops and raaf squadrons replaced us garrisons in eastern new guinea , new britain , and bougainville , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining japanese forces there . in may , i corps , the australian first tactical air force and usaaf and usn units began the borneo campaign , which continued until the end of the war . these campaigns contributed little to japan s defeat and remain controversial . following japan s surrender on august australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of borneo and the eastern netherlands east indies until british and dutch colonial rule was restored . australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of japanese personnel . , australians enlisted during the war , while , served overseas . casualties included , killed and another , were wounded . victoria crosses were awarded to australians . post war period demobilisation and peace time defence arrangements the demobilisation of the australian military following the end of the second world war was completed in . plans for post war defence arrangements were predicated on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force . it was envisioned that the royal australian navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers , two cruisers , six destroyers , others ships in commission and another in reserved . the royal australian air force would have a strength of squadrons , including four manned by the citizen air force . meanwhile , in a significant departure from previous australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces , the australian army would include a permanent field force of , regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support , serving alongside a part time force of , men in the citizen military forces . the australian regular army was subsequently formed on september , while the cmf was re raised on july . occupation of japan , in the immediate post war period australia contributed significant forces to the allied occupation of japan as part of the british commonwealth occupation force bcof , which included forces from australia , britain , india and new zealand . at its height in the australian component consisted of an infantry brigade , four warships and three fighter squadrons , totalling , personnel . the australian army component initially consisted of the th brigade which arrived in japan in february and was based in hiroshima prefecture . the three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the st , nd and rd battalions of the royal australian regiment in , and the th brigade became the st brigade when it returned to australia in december , forming the basis of the post war regular army . from that time the australian army contribution to the occupation of japan was reduced to a single under strength battalion . australian forces remained until september when the bcof ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the korean peninsular following the outbreak of the korean war in . the raaf component consisted of nos. , and squadrons as part of no. wing raaf flying p mustangs , initially based at bofu from march , before transferring to iwakuni in . however , by only no. squadron remained in japan . a total of ten ran warships served in japan during this period , including hma ships australia , hobart , shropshire , arunta , bataan , culgoa , murchison , shoalhaven , quadrant and quiberon , while hmas ships manoora , westralia and kanimbla also provided support . cold war early planning and commitments during the early years of the cold war , australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the western world and eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the united nations , or a coalition led by either the united states or britain . the middle east was considered the most likely area of operations for australian forces , where they would most likely operate with british forces . early commitments included the involvement of raaf aircrew during the berlin airlift in and the deployment of no. wing raaf to malta in the mediterranean from to . meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a national service scheme in to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the army , raaf and ran . korean war , on june , the north korean army kpa crossed the border into south korea and advanced for the capital seoul , which fell in less than a week . north korean forces continued toward the port of pusan and two days later the united states offered its assistance to south korea . in response the united nations security council requested members to assist in repelling the north korean attack . australia initially contributed p mustang fighter bomber aircraft from no. squadron raaf and infantry from the rd battalion , royal australian regiment rar , both of which were stationed in japan as part of the bcof . in addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the british commonwealth forces korea . the ran frigate hmas shoalhaven , and the destroyer hmas bataan , were also committed . later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard hmas sydney was added to the force . by the time rar arrived in pusan on september , the north koreans were in retreat following the inchon landings . as a part of the invasion force under the un supreme commander , general douglas macarthur , the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at battle of yongju near pyongyang on october , before advancing towards the yalu river . further successful actions followed at kujin on october and at chongju on october . north korean casualties were heavy , while australian losses included their commanding officer , lieutenant colonel charles green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on november . meanwhile , during the last weeks of october the chinese had moved divisions of the people s volunteer army across the yalu river to reinforce the remnants of the kpa . undetected by us and south korean intelligence , the th army group crossed the border on october and penetrated up to kilometres mi into north korea , and were reinforced in early november by divisions from the th army group in total divisions composed of , men . rar fought its first action against the chinese at pakchon on november . the fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake . following the chinese intervention , the un forces were defeated in successive battles and rar was forced to withdraw to the th parallel . a series of battles followed at uijeongbu on january , as the british and australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the south korean capital . further fighting occurred at chuam ni on february following another chinese advance , and later at maehwa san between march as the un resumed the offensive . australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in , with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the battle of kapyong . on april , chinese forces attacked the kapyong valley and forced the south korean defenders to withdraw . australian and canadian troops were ordered to halt this chinese advance . after a night of fighting the australians recaptured their positions , at the cost of men killed and wounded . in july , the australian battalion became part of the combined canadian , british , australian , new zealand , and indian st commonwealth division . the second major battle took place during operation commando and occurred after the chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the imjin river . the st commonwealth division counter attacked on october , capturing a number of objectives including hill and hill during the battle of maryang san after five days the chinese retreated . australian casualties included dead and wounded . the belligerents then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the first world war , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and sandbagged forts behind barbed wire defences . from until the end of the war , rar held trenches on the eastern side of the division s positions in the hills northeast of the imjin river . across from them were heavily fortified chinese positions . in march , australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions , sending rar . this battalion remained in korea for months , before being replaced by rar in april . the australians fought their last battle during july , with rar holding off a concerted chinese attack along the samichon river and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and wounded . hostilities were suspended on july . , australians served during the war , with killed , , wounded and captured . malayan emergency , the malayan emergency was declared on june , after three estate managers were murdered by members of the malayan communist party mcp . australian involvement began in june , when in response to a british request , six lincolns from no. squadron and a flight of dakotas from no. squadron arrived in singapore to form part of the british commonwealth far east air force feaf . the dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as paratroop and leaflet drops , while the lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the communist terrorist ct jungle bases . the raaf were particularly successful , and in one such mission known as operation termite , five lincoln bombers destroyed communist camps , killed communists and forced one into surrender , in a joint operation with the raf and ground troops . the lincolns were withdrawn in , and were replaced by canberra bombers from no. squadron and cac sabres from no. wing . based at raaf base butterworth they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas . australian ground forces were deployed to malaya in october as part of the far east strategic reserve . in january , the first australian ground forces were deployed on malaysian peninsula , consisting of the nd battalion , royal australian regiment rar . rar mainly participated in mopping up operations over the next months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the ct jungle bases , as part of th british commonwealth brigade . contact with the enemy was infrequent and results small , achieving relatively few kills . rar left malaysia october to be replaced by rar . rar underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving mcp insurgents back into the jungle of perak and kedah . the new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes . again contact was limited , although rar had more success than its predecessor . by late , operations against the mcp were in their final phase , and most communists had been pushed back and across the thailand border . rar left malaysia october and was replaced by rar . though patrolling the border rar did not make contact with the insurgents , and in october it was replaced by rar , which stayed in malaysia until august . the malayan emergency officially ended on july . australia also provided artillery and engineer support , along with an air field construction squadron . the royal australian navy also served in malayan waters , firing on suspected communist positions between and . the emergency was the longest continued commitment in australian military history , australians served and died in malaya although only were on operations and another were wounded . military and naval growth during the s at the start of the s , prime minister robert menzies greatly expanded the australian military so that it could carry out the government s policy of forward defence in south east asia . in , menzies announced a large increase in defence spending . the strength of the australian army would be increased by over three years from , to , providing a full three brigade division with nine battalions . the raaf and ran would also both be increased by . in , conscription or national service was re introduced under the national service act , for selected year olds based on date of birth , for a period of two years continuous full time service the previous scheme having been suspended in . in , three charles f. adams class destroyers were purchased from the united states to replace the ageing q class destroyers . traditionally , the ran had purchased designs based on those of the royal navy and the purchase of american destroyers was significant . hmas perth and hmas hobart joined the fleet in , followed by hmas brisbane in . other projects included the construction of six river class frigates , the conversion of the aircraft carrier hmas melbourne to an anti submarine role , the acquisition of ten wessex helicopters , and the purchase of six oberon class submarines . the raaf took delivery of their first mirage fighters in , equipping no. , no. and no. squadrons with them . the service also received american f strike aircraft , c hercules transports , p orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and italian macchi trainers . indonesia malaysia confrontation , the indonesia malaysia confrontation was fought from to between the british commonwealth and indonesia over the creation of the federation of malaysia , with the commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state . the war remained limited , and was fought primarily on the island of borneo , although a number of indonesian seaborne and airborne incursions onto the malay peninsula did occur . as part of australia s continuing military commitment to the security of malaysia , army , naval and airforce units were based there as part of the far east strategic reserve . regardless the australian government was wary of involvement in a war with indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the malayan peninsula only . on two occasions australian troops from rar were used to help mop up infiltrators from seaborne and airborne incursions at labis and pontian , in september and october . following these raids the government conceded to british and malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to borneo . during the early phases , british and malaysian troops had attempted only to control the malaysian indonesian border , and to protect population centres . however , by the time the australian battalion deployed the british had decided on more aggressive action , crossing the border into kalimantan to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the indonesians to remain on the defensive , under the codename operation claret . the fighting took place in mountainous , jungle clad terrain , and a debilitating climate , with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border , cross border operations , the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply , and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions . rar deployed to borneo in march , and served in sarawak until the end of july , operating on both sides of the border . the battalion had four major contacts with indonesian forces and several smaller ones including at sungei koemba , kindau and babang during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the indonesians as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents . rar served a less eventful tour between april and august , and also operated over the border , successfully clashing with the indonesians on a number of occasions . a squadron of the special air service regiment sasr was also deployed in and again in , taking part in cross border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the indonesians , even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance . other units included artillery and engineers , while a number of ran ships were involved in shelling indonesian positions in borneo and in repelling infiltrators in the singapore strait . the raaf played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated . operations in borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in australia , while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross border missions only occurred in . following a military coup in indonesia in early which brought general suharto to power , a peace treaty was signed in august which ended the conflict . , australians served during confrontation casualties included dead , with seven killed in action and eight wounded . vietnam war , australia s involvement in the vietnam war was driven largely by the rise of communism in southeast asia after the second world war , and the fear of its spread which developed in australia during the s and early s . as a consequence , australia supported south vietnam throughout the early s . in and , the leader of the south vietnamese government , ngo dinh diem , asked for assistance from the us and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist north vietnam . australia offered military advisors from the australian army training team vietnam , which became known simply as the team . they arrived in july and august , beginning australia s involvement in the war . later in august , the raaf sent a flight of caribou transport aircraft to the port city of vung tau . however , with the security situation in south vietnam continuing to deteriorate , the us increased its involvement to , combat troops by early . australia also committed ground forces , dispatching the rar to serve with the us rd airborne brigade in bien hoa province in june and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including gang toi , operation crimp and suoi bong trang . in march , the australian government announced the deployment of a brigade sized unit the st australian task force atf to replace rar . included were a large number of conscripts , under the increasingly controversial national service scheme . consisting of two infantry battalions as well as armour , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at nui dat , in phuoc tuy province . included were the iroquois helicopters of no. squadron raaf . at the battle of long tan on august , d company , rar with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a viet cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself . australians were killed and wounded , while communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield . the battle allowed the australians to gain dominance over phuoc tuy province and atf was not fundamentally challenged again . regardless , during february the australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point , losing men killed and wounded in a single week , the bulk during operation bribie . yet with the phuoc tuy province coming progressively under control throughout , the australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield . atf was subsequently deployed astride infiltration routes leading to saigon to interdict communist movement against the capital as part of operation coburg during the tet offensive and later during the battle of coral balmoral in may and june . at fire support bases coral and balmoral the australians had clashed with regular north vietnamese army and viet cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war . during days of fighting australian casualties included killed and wounded , while communist casualties included killed confirmed by body count , possibly killed , wounded and captured . other significant australian actions included binh ba in june , hat dich in late december and early and long khanh in june . at the height of the australian commitment , atf numbered , troops , including three infantry battalions , armour , artillery , engineers , logistics and aviation units in support . a third raaf unit , no. squadron raaf , flying canberra bombers , was sent in , and four ran destroyers joined us patrols in the waters off north vietnam . the australian withdrawal effectively commenced in november . as a consequence of the overall allied strategy of vietnamization and with the australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , rar was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty . atf was again reduced to just two infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining . australian combat forces were further reduced during as part of a phased withdrawal , and atf ceased operations in october . meanwhile , the advisors remained to train south vietnamese troops until withdrawn on december by the newly elected labor government of gough whitlam . the last australian forces were finally withdrawn in . the vietnam war was australia s longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation s military involvement increased a vocal anti war movement developed . more than , australians served in vietnam were killed and , were wounded . four were awarded the victoria cross . post vietnam era creation of the australian defence force , although the importance of joint warfare had been highlighted during second world war when australian naval , ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands , the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co ordination between the services in the post war era , with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine . the need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the australian military s experiences in the vietnam war . in , the secretary of the department of defence , arthur tange , submitted a report to the government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of chief of the defence force staff . the whitlam labor government subsequently amalgamated the five defence ministries defence , navy , army , air force , and supply into a single department of defence in , while conscription under the national service scheme was abolished . on january , the three branches of the australian military were brought together as a unified , all volunteer , professional force known as the australian defence force adf . today , the adf is headquartered at russell offices in canberra and is divided into air , land , maritime and special operations commands . in addition , northern command is based in darwin , and is responsible for operations in northern australia . defence of australia , s and s until the s , australia s military strategy centred on the concept of forward defence , in which the role of australian military and naval forces were to co operate with allied forces to counter threats in australia s region . following the adoption of the guam doctrine by the united states in , and the british withdrawal east of suez in the early s , australia developed a defence policy emphasising self reliance and the defence of the australian continent . known as the defence of australia policy , it focused australian defence planning on protecting the nation s northern maritime approaches the air sea gap against possible attack . in line with this goal , the adf was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from australian bases and to counter raids on continental australia . this was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the ran and raaf , and relocating regular army units to northern australia . during this time the adf had no military units on operational deployment outside australia . however , in the adf made its first operational deployment as part of operation morris dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off fiji in response to the fijian coups d tat . while broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for the adf to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events . during this period australia continued to retain forces in malaysia as part of the five power defence arrangements fpda agreed in to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces . however , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from singapore in , and the two mirage fighter squadrons in . since then a detachment of orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as rifle company butterworth have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments of f a hornet fighter aircraft . australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout asian waters in the last decades of the cold war . airforce and navy units were also involved in tracking soviet ship and submarine movements in the region . since then the orions have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of operation gateway , conducting patrols over the indian ocean , strait of malacca and south china sea . they have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights . gulf war , australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the gulf war , deploying a naval task group of two warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team in total about personnel . the australian contribution was the first time australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the adf and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure . however , the australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against iraq following the invasion of kuwait . some adf personnel serving on exchange with british and american units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions . following the war , the navy regularly deployed a frigate to the persian gulf or red sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to iraq . a number of australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with us and british air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no fly zones imposed over iraq between and . global security , late s since the late s , the australian government had increasingly called upon the adf to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world . while most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists , several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel . large peacekeeping deployments were made to namibia in early , cambodia between and , somalia in , rwanda between and and bougainville in and from onwards . the election of the howard liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the adf s force structure and role , with the new government s defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co operation with regional states and australia s allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of australia s global security interests . in line with this new focus , the adf s force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the adf s combat effectiveness . new millennium east timor , the former portuguese colony of east timor was invaded by indonesia in , however , following years of violent struggle the new indonesian government of president b.j. habibie subsequently agreed to allow the east timorese to vote on autonomy in . the united nations mission in east timor unamet was established to organise and conduct the vote , which was held at the end of august and resulted with . of voters deciding in favour of independence . however , following the announcement of the results pro indonesian militias supported by elements of the indonesian military , launched a campaign of violence , looting and arson and many east timorese were killed , while perhaps more than , were displaced . unable to control the violence , indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force . australia , which had contributed police to unamet , organised and led an international military coalition , known as the international force for east timor interfet , a non un force operating in accordance with un resolutions . the total size of the australian force committed numbered , personnel , and included a significant ground force , supported by air and naval forces , in the largest single deployment of australian forces since . under the overall command of australian major general peter cosgrove , interfet began arriving on september and was tasked with restoring peace and security , protecting and supporting unamet , and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations . with the withdrawal of the indonesian armed forces , police and government officials from east timor , unamet re established its headquarters in dili on september . on october , indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a un peacekeeping force , the united nations transitional administration in east timor untaet was established , becoming fully responsible for the administration of east timor during its transition to independence . the hand over of command of military operations from interfet to untaet was completed on february . australia continued to support the un peacekeeping operation with between , and , personnel , as well as landing craft and blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission . during these operations australian forces regularly clashed with pro indonesian militia and on a number of occasions indonesian forces as well , especially along the border with west timor . significant actions occurred in suai , mota ain and at aidabasalala in october . however , with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the australian and un forces were withdrawn by . two australians died from non battle related causes , while a number were wounded in action . the unexpected deployment to east timor in led to significant changes in australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the adf s ability to conduct operations outside australia . this successful deployment was the first time a large australian military force had operated outside of australia since the vietnam war and revealed shortcomings in the adf s ability to mount and sustain such operations . in response , the defence white paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the adf for overseas deployments . the australian government committed to improve the adf s capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of adf units , expanding the adf to , full time personnel and increasing real defence expenditure by per year . in may , , adf personnel were again deployed to east timor as part of operation astute , following unrest between elements of the timor leste defence force . australian forces were involved in a number skirmishes during this time , including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by alfredo reinado at same on march . however , by early the security situation had been stabilised and just australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force . following a drawdown , the international stabilisation force commenced withdrawing from timor leste in november , a process which was completed in april . afghanistan , present shortly after the islamist inspired terrorist attacks in new york and washington on september , australian forces were committed to the american led international coalition against terrorism . the adf s most visible contribution codenamed operation slipper has been a special forces task group operating in afghanistan from to and again from mid to fight against the taliban . over time the australian commitment has grown , with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a reconstruction task force from to provide security , reconstruction and to mentor and train the afghan national army . australia has also contributed a frigate and two ap c orion surveillance aircraft and three c hercules transport aircraft to international operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean since , supporting both the operations in afghanistan and those in iraq under operation catalyst . a detachment of four f a hornet fighter bombers was based at diego garcia from late to mid , while two boeing air to air refuelling aircraft were also based in manas air base in kyrgyzstan to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in afghan airspace but were later withdrawn . a special operations task group was deployed to support the reconstruction taskforce in april . in addition to radar crews , logistics and intelligence officers , and security personnel , this brought the number of australian personnel in afghanistan to by mid , with further small increases to , in mid , , in early and , in mid . a modest force remained in afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter insurgency operations in uruzgan province in conjunction united states and other coalition forces , including the dutch prior to their withdrawal . the force consisted of motorised infantry , special forces , engineers , cavalry , artillery and aviation elements . by it included a combined arms battalion sized battle group known as the mentoring task force , and the special operations task group , both based at forward operation base ripley outside of tarin kowt , as well as the rotary wing group flying ch d chinooks , the force logistics asset and an raaf air surveillance radar unit based in kandahar . in addition , a further australian logistic personnel were also based in the middle east in support , but are located outside of afghanistan . meanwhile , detachments of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in iraq and afghanistan , based out of al minhad air base in the united arab emirates . also included is the deployment of one of the ran s frigates to the arabian sea and gulf of aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties . australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting , and significant actions included operation anaconda in and operation perth in , as well as actions in chora in , kakarak in , the shah wali kot and derapet in , and doan in although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements . casualties include killed and wounded , while another australian also died serving with the british army . four australians have been awarded the victoria cross for australia , the first such decorations in forty years . following a drawdown in forces , the last combat troops were withdrawn on december however , approximately personnel remain in afghanistan as trainers and advisers , and are stationed in kandahar and kabul . over , australian personnel have served in afghanistan . iraq , australian forces later joined british and american forces during the invasion of iraq . the initial contribution was also a modest one , consisting of just , personnel codenamed operation falconer . major force elements included special forces , rotary and fixed wing aviation and naval units . army units included elements from the sasr and th battalion , royal australian regiment commando , a ch chinook detachment and a number of other specialist units . ran units included the amphibious ship hmas kanimbla and the frigates hmas darwin and hmas anzac , while the raaf deployed f a hornets from no. squadron , a number of ap c orions and c hercules . the australian special forces task force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into iraq , while for a few days , the closest ground troops to baghdad were from the sasr . during the invasion the raaf also flew its first combat missions since the vietnam war , with no. squadron flying a total of sorties and dropping laser guided bombs . the iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power , and with their defeat the bulk of australian forces were withdrawn . while australia did not initially take part in the post war occupation of iraq , an australian army light armoured battlegroup designated the al muthanna task group and including aslav light armoured vehicles and infantry was later deployed to southern iraq in april as part of operation catalyst . the role of this force was to protect the japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of new iraqi army units . the amtg later became the overwatch battle group west obg w , following the hand back of al muthanna province to iraqi control . force levels peaked at , personnel in may including the obg w in southern iraq , the security detachment in baghdad and the australian army training team iraq . a ran frigate was based in the north persian gulf , while raaf assets included c h hercules and ap c elements . following the election of a new labor government under prime minister kevin rudd the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid , while raaf and ran operations were redirected to other parts of the middle east area of operations as part of operation slipper . low level operations continued , however , with a small australian force of soldiers remaining in iraq to protect the australian embassy in baghdad as part of secdet under operation kruger . secdet was finally withdrawn in august , and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for australia s diplomatic presence in iraq . although more than , personnel served during operations in iraq , australian casualties were relatively light , with two soldiers accidentally killed , while a third australian died serving with the british royal air force . a further personnel were wounded . two officers remained in iraq attached to the united nations assistance mission for iraq as part of operation riverbank . this operation concluded in november . military intervention against isil , present in june a small number of sasr personnel were deployed to iraq to protect the australian embassy when the security of baghdad was threatened by the northern iraq offensive . later , in august and september a number of raaf c and c j transport aircraft based in the middle east were used to conduct airdrops of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to airlift arms and munitions to forces in kurdish controlled northern iraq . in late september an air task group atg and special operations task group sotg were deployed to al minhad air base in the united arab emirates as part of the coalition to combat islamic state forces in iraq . equipped with f a f super hornet strike aircraft , a kc a multi role tanker transport , and an e a wedgetail airborne early warning control aircraft , the atg began operations on october . the sotg is tasked with operations to advise and assist iraqi security forces , and was deployed to iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the australian and iraqi governments . it began moving into iraq in early november . in april a strong unit known as task group taji was deployed to iraq to train the regular iraqi security forces . airstrikes were extended to syria in september . peacekeeping australia s involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse , and included participation in both united nations sponsored missions , as well as those as part of ad hoc coalitions . australians have been involved in more conflicts as peacekeepers than as belligerents however in comparative international terms , australia has only been a moderately energetic peacekeeper . although australia has had peacekeepers in the field continuously for years being among the first group of un military observers in indonesia in its commitments have generally been limited , consisting mostly of small numbers of high level and technical support troops such as signallers , engineers , medics , observers , and police . one significant commitment has been australia s ongoing involvement with the long running multinational force and observers in the sinai . the operational tempo started increasing in the mid s , when australia became involved in a series of high profile operations , deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including cambodia , rwanda , somalia , east timor , and the solomon islands . australia has been involved in close to separate missions , involving more than , personnel australians have died during these operations . military statistics ward churchill ward leroy churchill born is an american author and political activist . he was a professor of ethnic studies at the university of colorado boulder from until . the primary focus of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and native americans by the united states government . his work features controversial and provocative views , written in a direct , often confrontational style . in january , churchill s work attracted controversy because of the circulation of a essay , on the justice of roosting chickens , in which he argued the september attacks were a natural and unavoidable consequence of unlawful us foreign policy over the latter half of the th century the essay is well known for churchill s use of the phrase little eichmanns to describe the technocratic corps working in the world trade center . in march the university of colorado began investigating allegations that churchill had engaged in research misconduct it reported in june that he had done so . churchill was fired on july , , leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired because of the little eichmanns comment . churchill filed a lawsuit against the university of colorado for unlawful termination of employment . in april a denver jury found that churchill was wrongly fired , awarding him in damages . in july , a district court judge vacated the monetary award and declined churchill s request to order his reinstatement , deciding the university has quasi judicial immunity . in february , churchill appealed the judge s decision . in november , the colorado court of appeals upheld the lower court s ruling . in september , , the colorado supreme court upheld the lower courts decisions in favor of the university of colorado . on april , , the united states supreme court declined to hear the case . in a february

been a member of the unit , or a lrrp team . churchill received his b.a. in technological communications in and m.a. in communications theory in , both from sangamon state university , now the university of illinois at springfield . career in , churchill began working at the university of colorado boulder as an affirmative action officer in the university administration . he also lectured on american indian issues in the ethnic studies program . in , the university of colorado hired him as an associate professor , although he did not possess the academic doctorate usually required for the position . the following year he was granted tenure in the communications department , without the usual six year probationary period , after having been declined by the sociology and political science departments . he has long been interested in issues associated with the dawes act , which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households . connected with that was the federal government s first use of blood quantum to define individual membership in tribes , for what became known as the dawes rolls . since re establishing self governments , federally recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members , often related to descent from recognized historical lists , but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum . some of his published works address these issues , which he has interpreted as part of the federal government s policy of genocide against native americans . in churchill discussed his views with david barsamian in an interview you could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in ibero america . but in anglo america , while there was some preoccupation with it , it was not formalized until the passage of the general allotment act , mid s . at that point they began to define indian as being someone who was demonstrably and documentably of at least one quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group . you couldn t be an eighth cheyenne and an eighth arapaho and be an indian . you had to be a quarter cheyenne or a quarter arapaho or hopefully a quarter and a quarter . the reason for this was quite clear . they were identifying indians for purposes of allotting them individual parcels of land in the existing reservation base at that point . if they ran out of indians identifiable as such , then the rest of the land would be declared surplus . so it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of indianness that would minimize the number of indians that were available . it was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to indianness in the first place . it s become increasingly so ever since . david barsamian december . interview with ward churchill historical and current perspectives . z magazine . in , churchill moved to the new ethnic studies department of the university of colorado . in , he was promoted to full professor . he was selected as chairman of the department in june . in january , during the controversy over his remarks , churchill resigned as chairman of the ethnic studies department at the university of colorado his term as chair was scheduled to expire in june of that year . on may , , the investigative committee of the standing committee on research misconduct at the university of colorado concluded that churchill had committed multiple counts of academic misconduct , specifically plagiarism , fabrication , and falsification . on july , , churchill was fired for academic misconduct in an eight to one vote by the university of colorado s board of regents . genealogy and tribal affiliation in , churchill stated , i am myself of muscogee and creek descent on my father s side , cherokee on my mother s , and am an enrolled member of the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians . in , churchill wrote elsewhere that he is one eighth creek and one sixteenth cherokee . in , churchill told the colorado daily that he was one sixteenth creek and cherokee . churchill told the denver post in february that he is three sixteenths cherokee . in a statement dated may , , and posted on its website , the united keetoowah band initially said , the united keetoowah band would like to make it clear that mr. churchill is not a member of the keetoowah band and was only given an honorary associate membership in the early s because he could not prove any cherokee ancestry . the tribe said that all of churchill s past , present and future claims or assertions of keetoowah enrollment , written or spoken , including but not limited to biographies , curriculum vitae , lectures , applications for employment , or any other reference not listed herein , are deemed fraudulent by the united keetoowah band . two days later , the united keetoowah band replaced its statement and acknowledged churchill s alleged ancestry of being cherokee because mr. churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry , and his willingness to assist the ukb in promoting the tribe and its causes , he was awarded an associate membership as an honor , the tribe s website now said . however , mr. churchill may possess eligibility status for cherokee nation of oklahoma , since he claims cherokee . the tribe s spokesperson , lisa stopp , stated the tribe enrolls only members with certified one quarter american indian blood . the website statement further clarified that churchill was not eligible for tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a certificate of degree of indian blood cdib , and the associate membership did not entitle an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe . churchill has never asked for cdib certification , and finds the idea of being vetted by the us government offensive . in june , the united keetoowah band had voted to stop awarding associate memberships . such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual s assistance to the tribe , but it has nothing to do with indian ancestry , and it does not entitle an individual to vote in the tribe as a member . the keetoowah band states that churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded . in a separate interview , ernestine berry , formerly on the tribe s enrollment committee and four years on its council , said that churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe . in june , the rocky mountain news published an article about churchill s genealogy and family history . it turned up no evidence of a single indian ancestor among direct ancestors of churchill s identified from records . the news reported that both churchill s birth parents were listed as white on the census , as were all but two of his great great grandparents listed on previous census and other official documents . the news found that some of churchill s accounts of where his ancestors had lived did not agree with documented records . numerous members of churchill s extended family have longstanding family legends of indian ancestry among ancestors but , none was confirmed among the direct forebears of churchill who were identified . documents in churchill s university personnel file show that he was granted tenure in a special opportunity position . in , then cu boulder chancellor james corbridge refused to take action on allegations that churchill was fraudulently claiming to be an indian , saying it has always been university policy that a person s race or ethnicity is self proving . some of churchill s native american critics , such as vernon bellecourt white earth ojibwe and suzan shown harjo southern cheyenne muscogee creek , argue that his assertion of native american ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute misrepresentation and grounds for termination . the university has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity . the university of colorado s research misconduct committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship . the committee concluded that the allegation was not appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct . in a interview in the rocky mountain news , churchill said , i have never been confirmed as having one quarter blood , and never said i was . and even if the critics are absolutely right , what does that have to do with this issue i have never claimed to be goddamned sitting bull . the longtime indigenous activist russell means said in february of that year , so i want , from this day forward , every media person nationally , internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that ward churchill is a full blooded indian leader . blood quantum churchill has responded to requests for verification of his claimed indian heritage in various ways , including attacking the blood quantum upon which some native american tribes establish their membership requirements . churchill argues that the united states instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency . for decades in his writings , churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose . he says , set the blood quantum at one quarter , hold to it as a rigid definition of indians , let intermarriage proceed as it has and eventually indians will be defined out of existence . churchill s assertions have been raised as one of the several research misconduct allegations that were brought against him in see below . he has been accused of using his interpretation of the dawes act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member . writing churchill has written on american indian history and culture , and speaks about genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the americas by european settlers and what he describes as the repression of native peoples that continues to this day . as of , according to a report submitted on his behalf , churchill has written books on his own and co authored . some have been reprinted with updates . he has written book chapters , law reviews , and scholarly essays of these were refereed . he has edited volumes and co edited more . according to the university of colorado investigation , his academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation , drawing upon studies by other scholars , not monographs describing new research based on primary sources . the investigation also noted that he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals , not in the university presses or mainstream peer reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics . in addition to his academic writing , churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion . in , churchill wrote an essay titled pacifism as pathology notes on an american pseudopraxis criticizing pacifist politics within the u.s. left as being hypocritical , de facto racist and ineffectual . in , arbeiter ring publishing published the essay in a book entitled pacifism as pathology reflections on the role of armed struggle in north america and listing ward churchill as the author . the book included a preface by ed mead , a new introduction to the essay by churchill and a commentary by mike ryan . the book sparked much debate in leftist circles and inspired more aggressive tactics within the anti globalization movement in the following few years . agents of repression , co authored by jim vander wall , describes what the authors claim was a secret war against the black panther party and american indian movement carried out during the late s and s by the fbi under the cointelpro program . the cointelpro papers reissued , also co authored with jim vander wall , examines a series of original fbi memos that detail the bureau s activities against various leftist groups , from the u.s. communist party in the s to activists concerned with central american issues in the s . in fantasies of the master race , churchill examines the portrayal of american indians and the use of american indian symbols in popular american culture . he focuses on such phenomena as tony hillerman s mystery novels , the film dances with wolves , and the new age movement , finding examples of cultural imperialism and exploitation . churchill calls author carlos castaneda s claims of revealing the teachings of a yaqui indian shaman , the greatest hoax since piltdown man . struggle for the land reissued is a collection of essays in which churchill chronicles what he describes as the u.s. government s systematic exploitation of native lands and the killing or displacement of american indians . he details native american efforts in the th and th centuries to prevent defoliation and industrial practices such as surface mining . churchill s indians are us , a sequel to fantasies of the master race , further explores american indian issues in popular culture and politics . he examines the movie black robe , the pine ridge indian reservation killings , the prosecution of leonard peltier , sports mascots , the indian arts and crafts act of , and blood quantum laws , calling them tools of genocide . churchill is particularly outspoken about new age exploitations of shamanism and american indian sacred traditions , and the do it yourself indianism of certain contemporary authors . john p. lavelle of the university of new mexico school of law published a review of indians are us in the american indian quarterly . professor lavelle , an enrolled member of the santee sioux nation , states that indians are us twists historical facts and is hostile toward indian tribes . it was in this book that churchill first made the claim that the united states distributed smallpox infested blankets to indian tribes , a claim which he repeated several times over the next decade . the claim has been criticized as a falsification . churchill has , however , received support from some scholars . from a native son selected essays on indigenism , is a collection of previously published essays on native american history , culture , and political activism . in his introduction to this volume , howard zinn lauds the emergence of a new generation of native american scholars and describes churchill s writing as powerful , eloquent , unsparing of cant and deception . churchill s a little matter of genocide is a survey of ethnic cleansing in the americas from to the present . he compares the treatment of north american indians to historical instances of genocide by the khmer rouge in cambodia , turks against armenians , and europeans against the gypsies , as well as nazis against the poles and jews . in perversions of justice , churchill argues that the u.s. s legal system was adapted to gain control over native american people . tracing the evolution of federal indian law , churchill argues that the principles set forth were not only applied to non indians in the u.s. , but later adapted for application abroad . he concludes that this demonstrates the development of the u.s. s imperial logic , which depends on a corrupt form of legalism to establish colonial control and empire . churchill s controversial essay on was expanded into a book length manuscript , published as on the justice of roosting chickens reflections on the consequences of u.s. imperial arrogance and criminality by ak press . the book features two other chapters , one listing us military interventions , another listing what churchill believes to be us violations of international law . the original essay takes the roosting chickens of the title from a malcolm x speech , in which malcolm x linked the assassination of u.s. president john f. kennedy to the violence which kennedy perpetuated as merely a case of chickens coming home to roost . churchill s essays in this book address the worldwide forms of resistance that he posits were and continue to be provoked by u.s. imperialism of the th and st centuries . in kill the indian , save the man the genocidal impact of american indian residential schools , churchill traces the history of removing american indian children from their homes to residential schools in canada or indian boarding schools in the usa as part of government policies s s which he regards as genocidal . activism on native american issues churchill has been active since at least as the co director of the denver based american indian movement of colorado , now an autonomous chapter of the american indian movement . in , he and other local aim leaders , including russell means , glenn t. morris , robert robideau , and david hill , broke with the national aim leadership , including dennis banks and the brothers vernon and clyde bellecourt , claiming that all aim chapters are autonomous . the aim grand governing council is based in minneapolis and retains the name of the national group . it says that the schism arose when means , churchill , glenn t. morris and others openly supported the miskito indian group misurasata , who were allied with the anti revolutionary , cia backed contras . journalists such as harlan mckosato attributed the split to means and other aim members dividing over opposition to the bellecourt brothers because of their alleged involvement in the execution of anna mae aquash in december , who was then the highest ranking woman in aim but had been suspected of being an informant . it was a year in which other fbi informants had been discovered in aim . on november , , means held a press conference in denver , colorado in which he accused the bellecourt brothers of complicity in aquash s death , and named three lower level aim members involved in her death arlo looking cloud , john graham , and theda nelson clark . this was the first time that an aim leader active at the time of the aquash murder had publicly accused aim of having been involved . looking cloud and graham were convicted of murder in and , by federal and south dakota state juries , respectively . by then clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted . means attributed the split in aim to divisions in the aftermath of aquash s murder . the journalist harlan mckosato said in , ... her aquash s death has divided the american indian movement ... the schism continued , with the national aim leadership claiming that the local aim leaders , such as churchill , are tools of the u.s. government used against other american indians . the leaders of the national aim organization , now called aim grand governing council , claim that churchill has worked in the past as an underground counter intelligence source for the u.s. government , for example the fbi , and local , non indian , police forces , to subvert the national aim organization . specifically , they refer to a boulder , colorado interview with jodi rave , a former columnist for the denver post , in which churchill stated that he was teaching the rapid city police department about the american indian movement . in addition , vernon bellecourt accused churchill of having fraudulently represented himself as an indian to bolster his credentials . bellecourt said he complained to the university of colorado about this as early as . churchill has been a leader of colorado aim s annual protests in denver against the columbus day holiday and its associated parade . colorado aim s leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the denver italian american community , the main supporters of the parade . as early as , churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional , arguing that the ninth amendment to the constitution provides native americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays , overriding the first amendment rights of non native americans . essay controversy churchill wrote an essay in september entitled on the justice of roosting chickens . in it , he argued that the september attacks were provoked by u.s. foreign policy . he compared the role of financial workers at the world trade center in ongoing genocidal american imperialism to the role played by adolf eichmann in organizing the holocaust . in , this essay was widely publicized when hamilton college invited churchill to speak . this led to both condemnations of churchill and counter accusations of mccarthyism by churchill and supporters . following the controversy , the university of colorado interim chancellor phil distefano said , while professor churchill has the constitutional right to express his political views , his essay on has outraged and appalled us and the general public . a documentary called shouting fire stories from the edge of free speech , broadcast on hbo , prominently features churchill s case in addressing the issues of free speech and first amendment rights . research misconduct investigation the controversy attracted increased academic attention to churchill s research , which had already been criticized by the legal scholar john lavelle and historian guenter lewy . additional critics were the sociologist thomas brown , who had been preparing an article on churchill s work , and the historians r.g. robertson and russell thornton , who claimed that churchill had misrepresented their work . in , university of colorado boulder administrators ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research misconduct , including three allegations of plagiarism , and four allegations of fabrication or falsification regarding the history of the dawes act , the indian arts and crafts act of , and statements that smallpox was intentionally spread to native americans by john smith in and by the united states army at fort clark in not to be confused with the well documented use of smallpox infected blankets at fort pitt in . on may , the university released their findings the investigative committee agreed unanimously that churchill had engaged in serious research misconduct , including falsification , fabrication , and two of the three allegations of plagiarism . the committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions . the standing committee on research misconduct accepted the findings of the investigative committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed . churchill s appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the university s privilege and tenure committee , which found that two of the seven findings of misconduct did not constitute dismissible offences . three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year s suspension without pay , while two favored dismissal . on july , , the university regents voted seven to two to uphold all seven of the findings of research misconduct , overruling the recommendation of privilege and tenure panel that two be dismissed . by a vote of eight to one , the regents determined to fire churchill . the next day , churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views . the jury in churchill s suit for reinstatement weighed the university s claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case . as stanley fish said , it was the jury s task to determine whether churchill s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements . the jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to churchill s firing and rejected the university s academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal . on april , , a colorado jury found that churchill had been wrongly fired , and awarded in damages . as one of the jurors said later in a press interview , it wasn t a slap in his face or anything like that when we didn t give him any money . it s just that churchill s attorney david lane kept saying this wasn t about the money , and in the end , we took his word for that . churchill s counsel asked chief judge larry j. naves of the denver district court to order reinstatement in light of the verdict . on july , , judge naves found that the defendants university were entitled to quasi judicial immunity as a matter of law , vacated the jury verdict and determined that the university did not owe churchill any financial compensation . naves denied churchill s request for reinstatement at cu . churchill appealed both decisions . on november , , a three judge panel of the colorado court of appeals affirmed the trial court s decision . in february , churchill filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the colorado supreme court . in late may , the colorado supreme court agreed to hear his case . court records indicate that oral arguments began june , . on september , , the court ruled that the university had quasi judicial immunity , upholding the trial court s ruling . on april , , the u.s. supreme court declined to hear an appeal from churchill . honors , alfred university awarded him an honorary doctorate of humane letters . works books , as editor marxism and native

associated with native american culture . he uses historical photographs as source material for works . in the early s at santa fe indian market , churchill protested the passage of the indian arts and crafts act . it requires that , to identify and exhibit works as being by a native american , artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a native american tribe or designated by a tribe as an artisan . under federal law , churchill cannot identify his art as by a native american . some of churchill s pieces may infringe copyrights . for example , his serigraph winter attack was , according to churchill and others , based on a drawing by the artist thomas e. mails churchill printed copies of winter attack and sold at least one of them . other copies are available online for purchase . churchill says that , when he produced winter attack , he publicly acknowledged that it was based on mails work . the online journal artnet mentions churchill s artwork and the controversy surrounding its originality . exit through the kwik e mart exit through the kwik e mart is the fifteenth episode of the twenty third season of the american animated television sitcom the simpsons . it originally aired on the fox network in the united states on march , . in the episode , bart is punished by homer after causing trouble . he gets revenge on his father by spray painting images of him with the

arrests bart for covering the town in graffiti . it turns out that fairey is an undercover officer working for wiggum . the episode references the street art documentary exit through the gift shop by graffiti artist banksy , and features guest appearances from street artists ron english , kenny scharf , and robbie conal as themselves . fairey , who is a long time fan of the simpsons , also guest starred in the episode as himself . around . million americans tuned in to watch exit through the kwik e mart during its original broadcast . since then , the episode has received praise from television critics for its opening sequence , which parodies the opening sequence of the medieval fantasy television series game of thrones . plot as a birthday gift for marge , homer buys a blender designed by television chef paula paul . he goes to a health food store called swapper jack s , where paula is giving away autographs , to have paula sign it . homer is impressed by the store and says he will not be shopping at the kwik e mart any more . apu , who is there to spy , overhears homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of apu and take him away . at the signing , homer tells paula that marge is a big fan of hers . paula decides that she will call marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday . meanwhile , bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday . the rabbit chews through the phone lines in the simpsons home , causing marge to miss paula s call . paula becomes furious at marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show . homer punishes bart by locking him up in the rabbit s cage . to get revenge on homer , bart goes around springfield spray painting graffiti of homer s face and the word dope . when his work appears on the television news , it encourages bart to create even more graffiti in the town . street artists shepard fairey , ron english , kenny scharf , and robbie conal encounter bart one night when he is making some graffiti . the four tell bart that they are impressed by his work and would like to showcase his art in a gallery show , at first bart is unsure , but bart remembers how homer treated him , and then agrees . meanwhile , the kwik e mart suffers because of the competition from swapper jack s . apu ends up attempting to rob swapper jack s in a desperate measure , but the cashier snake jailbird convinces him to hand over the gun . later , apu is about to shut down the kwik e mart when his wife manjula tells him that swapper jack s is closing because it was discovered they were selling monkey meat imported from brazil as chicken . homer initially refuses to attend bart s show because he discovers the artwork is an insult to him , but changes his mind after bart apologizes and writes i m sorry on the hood of homer s car . at the show , chief wiggum and the springfield police department suddenly appear to arrest bart for making graffiti throughout the town . it is revealed that the gallery show is a sham and that fairey is an undercover officer who helped the police identify bart as the graffiti artist that had been spray painting springfield . since bart is just a boy , he is not sent to jail . instead , he is punished by once again being locked up in the rabbit cage . when bart tells wiggum that he has to go to the bathroom , wiggum covers the cage with the blanket and finds bart gone when he removes the blanket from the cage . production exit through the kwik e mart was written by marc wilmore and directed by steven dean moore as part of the twenty third season of the simpsons . it spoofs the debated status of street art as a true form of art . the title is a reference to exit through the gift shop , a street art documentary by graffiti artist banksy who produced the opening sequence of an earlier simpsons episode titled moneybart . the richard hawley song tonight the streets are ours , which is the theme song of exit through the gift shop , is included in the episode during a montage of bart painting graffiti in springfield . hayden childs of the a.v. club noted in his review of exit through the kwik e mart that the reveal that the art show was a police sting gives the show a moment to joke about the anti art market theme from exit through the gift shop . wiggum asks who would be stupid enough to pay for work that an amateur puts up for free in public , and the answer is , as in banksy s movie , the very wealthy , here represented by mr. burns . american street artist fairey guest starred in exit through the kwik e mart as himself . the graffiti art featuring homer s face and the word dope that bart creates in the episode is a reference to fairey s barack obama hope poster and his obey giant image . fairey has said that the simpsons has been one of his favorite television shows since the early s because of its blend of humor and social commentary , and he felt deeply honored to be included in an episode . fairey wrote on his website that part of being on the simpsons , is you re being honored as a reference point in culture . he described the plot of the episode as great , adding that the staff members of the show were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed even though i had to make fun of myself to do so . this was fairey s first acting performance . street artists english , scharf , and conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves . the traditional simpsons opening sequence was replaced in this episode with a redesigned version that spoofed the opening sequence of the hbo medieval fantasy series game of thrones . the game of thrones opening shows the various locations featured in the series on a three dimensional map of the fictional continent westeros . in the simpsons opening , these locations were substituted with places in springfield , and the wall was replaced with the simpson family s couch . the theme song featured in the game of thrones opening sequence was arranged by the simpsons composer alf clausen and used in the simpsons opening as well . nicholas mckaig , known for uploading a cappella covers of famous songs on youtube , performed the simpsons theme song over the closing credits of exit through the kwik e mart . he was recruited after a staff member of the show saw his cover of the simpsons theme on youtube . release exit through the kwik e mart was originally broadcast on the fox network in the united states on march , . it was watched by approximately . million people during this broadcast , and in the demographic for adults aged , the episode received a . nielsen rating and a seven percent share . this was a slight decrease from the previous episode , at long last leave , which acquired a . rating . the episode became the second highest rated broadcast in fox s animation domination lineup for the night in terms of both total viewers and in the demographic , finishing higher than new episodes of american dad , napoleon dynamite , and the cleveland show , but lower than a new family guy episode which received a . rating and was seen by . million people . for the week of february march , , exit through the kwik e mart placed th in the ratings among all prime time broadcasts in the demographic , and seventh among all fox prime time broadcasts . writing for the a.v. club , television reviewer hayden childs commented that exit through the kwik e mart was somewhat amusing and far more coherent than

historic site fort scott national historic site is a historical area under the control of the united states national park service in bourbon county , kansas , united states . named after general winfield scott , who achieved renown during the mexican american war , during the middle of the th century the fort served as a military base for us army action in what was the edge of settlement in . for the next quarter century , it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the west to settlement , a period which included bleeding kansas and the american civil war . the current national historic site protects historic structures , a parade ground , and five acres , m of restored tallgrass prairie , inside the city of fort scott . it is open to visitors most days of the year . history in , fort scott was named after winfield scott , was established on the american frontier on the military road in eastern kansas between fort leavenworth and fort gibson . it was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers , who were migrating from the eastern united states . fort scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the plains indians , as well as to protect the indians from the settlers encroachment . the united states government intention to reserve permanent indian lands west of the missouri river gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to encroach on the indian settlements . fort scott s most active days were between and , although it was also used during the civil war . army days the cherokee of indian territory now oklahoma were upset to have fort wayne in their proximity . after some delay , the us army decided to abandon fort wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between fort leavenworth and the site . the army both wanted to placate the cherokee who were supervised by the department of defense and provide more defense for white settlers and other indians against the osage , who had been conducting frequent raids in the area . on april , , some soldiers of fort wayne left their fort and on april arrived where fort scott would be built , in the osage cuestas section of modern day kansas . after haggling with the cherokees to acquire the land , the rest of fort wayne s garrison left the fort on may and arrived at the fort scott site on may . unlike most forts for military use , the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built the wide open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary . the soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men , animals , and equipment . these buildings were on the edges of a foot m parade ground . the post quartermaster , captain thomas swords , was in charge of building fort scott s structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction on the kansas prairie , which had few trees . he had only two bricklayers and three carpenters to rely on , as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform . wood was available , but the mill was built . miles . km away , making transport time consuming . swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood , skilled labor and working equipment . freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort s construction . as a result , only one duplex of the five planned officers quarters four duplexes and post commandant s house was built by , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed . in his inspection of the fort , colonel george croghan reported that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered fort scott above average . due to the rising tensions that escalated in the mexican american war , the us army redeployed troops to the southwest . with fort scott still uncompleted , officials decided on april , , that no more construction would be done there , after eight years and , . by the time it was finished , it was obsolete three years later , it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western fort riley . for the average soldier , life at the fort was monotonous . until the permanent structures were built , soldiers had to live in tents , which lacked comfort . aside from a few whiskey peddlers and prostitutes , few civilians lived at the fort . officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including captain swords . five miles east in missouri was a grog shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts martial followed soldiers going awol at the shop . the desertion rate from the fort ranged from , due to boredom , irregular pay , and hatred for military life . as no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base . hunting was a popular pastime according to captain swords , wolf chasing and duck hunting was the only way one officer could tolerate the place . bleeding kansas two years after the army abandoned the fort , the buildings were sold by auction to civilians , with two being converted to hotels . in the kansas nebraska act repealed the missouri compromise of , which had kept slavery out of kansas . missourians in favor of slavery soon moved to kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not kansas would permit slavery . settlers from new england arrived equally determined to keep it out . each of the two competing factions of the bleeding kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at fort scott free soil at the fort scott hotel and pro slavery at the western hotel . most of the residents in fort scott supported slavery , but those outside the town tended to the free soil side . during this time , there were local incidents of murder and attempted arson , typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting . army returns during the american civil war , the fort was renewed as a us military post . in august , the union army took command of fort scott , and readied it for the war times . the united states army also took over several blocks within the town for commissary and quartermaster functions . the union army rented the properties from the current civilian owners . troops from indiana , iowa , colorado , ohio , and wisconsin would come to the fort , and either stayed by the fort , or traveled farther , to subjugate missouri , arkansas , or the indian territory . fort scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the united states colored troops of the union army . a major supply depot was situated at the fort . confederate general sterling price hoped to capture the town , but the closest the confederate force came to the garrison was miles km away at battle of dry wood creek . the site was strategically important as it was within a southern sympathizing area and close to the confederate state of arkansas and the unstable indian territory present day state of oklahoma , where many of the members of the five civilized tribes were allied with the confederates . the fort served as a general hospital large military hospital and prison until after the war . following the end of the war , in october the us army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled . on january , , the army returned with the formation of the post of southeast kansas . the post was based at fort scott , but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks , and seldom used the original fort . they were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers . some of the latter feared that the railroad , which had been awarded land for development by the us government in rights of way , would evict them from their squatter homes . the settlers considered the troops lackeys to the railroads , and lumped both as enemies . settlers also had some continuing conflicts with indians and insurgents using the recent confederate cause as excuse for robbery . by the spring of , the us army withdrew the troops from fort scott for good . from to , the buildings of the fort were left unattended , and slowly deteriorated . many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use . modern times with the act of august , , the national park service gave the city government of fort scott , kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort . on october , , fort scott became a national historic site under the supervision of the national park service , encompassing acres , m . today the fort is open

slow , plodding tag match . regarding the marriage segment during the show , caldwell said it was just a bad , bad , bad segment that died slowly and painfully in front of the live audience . overall

thanhouser company . the film is a comedy of circumstances , in which the gale family is going to host a dinner . the focus of the humor is in a mince pie that brandy is added to in an attempt to make it more appreciable , but three people each add brandy to the pie . everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie , including the family cat , and the film concludes . no cast or staff credits for this film are known . the film was released on september , , to mixed reviews in trade publications . reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one pie split eight ways would be able to impact everyone . the film is presumed lost . plot though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in the moving picture world from september , . it states life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome , and were it not for the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given , existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed . so the time honored get togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay . the gales thought well of this established feature . they made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests . they were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time . on the night before such an event neither mamma , pappa , or daughter gale could get those minutes solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests comfort . at the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape . so little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie the gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie . first mamma gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state , and give it a stir then pappa gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir finally daughter gale would have to come over and honor it likewise . then arrived the guests . the minister and the mrs. minister , they were , and some neighbors . while she was receiving them the recollection came to mamma gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring . off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen . she pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests . then pappa gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored . he , too , excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince . no sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than daughter gale , who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring , rushes in and makes for the whiskey . she pours the right proportion in , too . production the writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely lloyd lonergan . he was an experienced newspaperman employed by the new york evening world while writing scripts for the thanhouser productions . the film director is unknown , but it may have been barry o neil . film historian q. david bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at

fortune , george middleton , grace moore , john w. noble , anna rosemond , mrs. george walters . a surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying eight actors . release and reception the single reel comedy , approximately , feet long , was released on september , . the film likely had a wide national release , with advertisements in theaters known in indiana , kansas , wisconsin , and pennsylvania . the film would also be shown in vancouver , canada and was met with praise by the audience at the province theatre . in , years after the film s release , the film was approved without censorship by the pennsylvania state board of censors of moving pictures . the the moving picture world reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a fault . the reviewer states , a domestic comedy with a different flavor . in fact , with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook , the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring , neither one knowing that the others have done likewise . the humor in this piece centers around this pie . what happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination . imagine eight people , not to speak of the cat , getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie ... we do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week . licensed as well as independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters . the mince pie episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone . walton of the moving picture news was not amused by the plot and stated , to me the last scene had no humor . it was only the necessary ending to the beginning . true humor does not emanate from cognac . the new york dramatic mirror stated , this is the old story of too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way . the early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation . ... a weak point in the story is the fact that the pie is cut into eight small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power . two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing . the character parts are all well taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera . back off boogaloo back off boogaloo is a song by english musician ringo starr , released as a non album single in march . starr s former beatles bandmate george harrison produced the recording , which took place in london shortly after the two had appeared together at harrison s concert for bangladesh shows in august . the single was a follow up to starr s hit song it don t come easy and continued his successful run as a solo artist . back off boogaloo peaked at number in britain and canada , and number on america s billboard hot . it remains starr s highest charting single in the united kingdom . the title for the song was inspired by english singer songwriter marc bolan . some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at paul mccartney , reflecting starr s disdain for the music mccartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years . back off boogaloo demonstrates the influence of glam rock on starr , who directed a documentary film , born to boogie , about bolan s band t. rex around this time . described by one author as a high energy in your face rocker , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by harrison and contributions from musicians gary wright and klaus voormann . starr re recorded back off boogaloo for his album stop and smell the roses , in a collaboration with american singer harry nilsson that incorporates lyrics from beatles songs such as with a little help from my friends , good day sunshine and baby , you re a rich man . the original version has appeared on starr s compilation albums blast from your past and photograph the very best of ringo starr , and as a bonus track on his remastered studio album goodnight vienna . since his return to touring in , starr has performed back off boogaloo regularly in concert with the various incarnations of his all starr band . background and composition ringo starr identified his initial inspiration for back off boogaloo as having come from marc bolan , the singer and guitarist with english glam rock band t. rex . in a interview with mojo editor paul du noyer , starr described bolan as a dear friend who used to come into the office when i was running apple movies , a big office in town , and the hang out for myself , harry nilsson and keith moon . over dinner one evening at starr s home outside london , bolan had used the word boogaloo so often that it stuck in starr s mind , after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight . when discussing the composition on vh storytellers in may , starr explained bolan was an energised guy . he used to speak back off boogaloo ... ooh you , boogaloo . do you want some potatoes ooh you , boogaloo starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children s toys that night , in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song . the lyrics to the middle eight of back off boogaloo came to starr while watching london weekend television s football show , the big match . the program s host , jimmy hill , often referred to a footballer s playing as tasty , a catchphrase that starr incorporated into his song lyrics get yourself together now and give me something tasty everything you try to do you know it sure sounds wasted . commentators have interpreted the song , and particularly this statement , as an attack by starr on his former beatles bandmate paul mccartney . starr has denied any such interpretation , instead claiming that the song was inspired by bolan and nothing more , beatles biographer robert rodriguez writes . starr had publicly criticised mccartney s solo albums mccartney and ram on release , and author bruce spizer paraphrases the message of the middle eight as a plea for paul to produce better music . the mention of sound ing wasted could also be a reference to mccartney s overindulgence with cannabis , rodriguez suggests . a further example of starr s allegedly anti mccartney message exists in the song s first verse wake up , meathead don t pretend that you are dead get yourself up off the cart . the same commentators suggest that here starr could be referring to the paul is dead hoax . the latter rumour circulated during september and october of that year while mccartney hid away on his scottish farm , disconsolate after john lennon had told him and starr that he wanted a divorce from the beatles . in addition to these supposed messages in back off boogaloo , observers have viewed the song title as starr s rebuke to mccartney to abandon his legal stand against the beatles and apple corps , which was placed in receivership in march after a high court judge found in mccartney s favour . author keith badman writes that boogaloo had long been cited as paul s nickname from his former bandmates starr , lennon and george harrison . while acknowledging that in subsequent years starr might have chosen to minimise any ill feeling towards mccartney , rodriguez notes that the lyrics just happened to fit perfectly into the us vs. paul mindset following the beatles break up , to the extent that back off boogaloo was as damning as early had been conciliatory . when tailoring his composition i m the greatest for starr to record on the album ringo , lennon referenced the song title with the lines now i m only thirty two and all i want to do is boogaloo . although t rex devotees , in the words of starr biographer alan clayson , claimed that bolan had ghost written back off boogaloo , starr later acknowledged that harrison co wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody . as on starr s hit single it don t come easy , harrison was not credited for his songwriting contribution . starr originally offered back off boogaloo to fellow liverpudlian cilla black to record , but she declined , hoping instead to record another new starr harrison composition , photograph . recording having earmarked the song as his next single , starr recorded back off boogaloo in september , following his appearance at the harrison organised concert for bangladesh in new york . the sessions took place at apple studio in central london , with harrison producing , as he had on it don t come easy . the recording reflects the influence of glam rock on starr through what authors chip madinger and mark easter term its big drum sound and repetitious nature , with a line up comprising starr vocals , drums , percussion , harrison guitars , gary wright piano and klaus voormann bass , saxophone . rodriguez describes starr s martial sounding opening as a rare showcase for his own drumming , while harrison biographer simon leng writes of a roaring series of harrison slide breaks that brought to mind duane allman . further overdubs included contributions from three backing vocalists , led by american soul singer madeline bell . blindman for the single s b side , starr had already written and recorded blindman , the theme song for the ferdinando baldi directed spaghetti western of the same name , filming for which starr had interrupted in order to perform at the concert for bangladesh . starr produced the track with voormann . the sessions for blindman took place at apple on august , with badfinger guitarist pete ham assisting starr and voormann . like the film blindman , the song is held in low regard by critics spizer describes it as a muddy sounding dirge with little to recommend . release and reception apple records issued the single on march in britain , as apple r , with a us release taking place three days later , as apple . it was starr s first release since it don t come easy , a year before . during this period , his priority had been to develop a career as an actor in films such as motels and blindman . further aligning himself with britain s glam rock movement , starr made his directorial debut with born to boogie , a film starring bolan that included starr s footage of a t. rex concert held at wembley on march . with back off boogaloo , nme critic bob woffinden noted starr s success in establishing himself in the two years since the beatles break up , and wrote that the single confirmed that he and harrison , dark horses both , were the ones who had managed their solo careers more purposefully and intelligently compared with mccartney and lennon . the song was a hit in the us , reaching number on the billboard hot , and achieved starr s best position on the uk singles chart , where it reached number . a promotional video for back off boogaloo was shot on march at lennon s tittenhurst park residence while starr was looking after the property . the video , which shows starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a frankenstein like monster , was directed by tom taylor and financed by caravel films . a similar monster appeared on the single s picture sleeve , holding a cigarette . alan clayson writes of reviewers criticising back off boogaloo for being repetitious , leading starr to respond in a interview play me a pop song that isn t . on release , chris welch wrote in melody maker a number one hit could easily be in store for the maestro of rock drums . there s a touch of the marc bolans in this highly playable rhythmic excursion ... it s hypnotic and effective , ideal for jukeboxes and liable to send us all mad by the end of the week . woffinden described the single as every bit as ebullient as it don t come easy , although slightly inferior , while mike degagne of allmusic views it as a song where t he jovial spirit of ringo starr shines through . in a article for the nme , charles shaar murray highlighted back off boogaloo as a great radio and juke box tune . among beatle biographers , simon leng terms it a rocking , soccer crowd chant that suited starr s talents well , and bruce spizer praises the track as a high energy in your face rocker propelled by ringo s thundering drums and george s stinging slide guitar . in the publication nme originals beatles the solo years , paul moody listed back off boogaloo first among starr s ten solo gems and described it as good time rock ndroll to match the faces . guitar world editor damian fanelli includes the song on his list of harrison s ten best post beatles guitar moments , saying of the recording the main event is clearly harrison s slightly wild , wacky and very bouncy slide guitar solo , which includes an alternate melody line that s even catchier than the melody ringo is singing . re releases for back off boogaloo include starr s greatest hits album , blast from your past , and , along with blindman , as a bonus track on the reissue of his goodnight vienna album . back off boogaloo also appeared on his compilation photograph the very best of ringo starr , the collector s edition of which included his video for the song . stop and smell the roses version starr recorded a new version of back off boogaloo for his album on boardwalk records , stop and smell the roses . the song was produced by starr s friend , singer harry nilsson , and features a musical arrangement by van dyke parks . similar to nilsson s cover of the beatles you can t do that , the remake incorporates lyrics from a number of the band s songs in this case , with a little help from my friends , help , lady madonna , good day sunshine and baby , you re a rich man , as well as starr s it don t come easy . in a further reference to his past , the version of back off boogaloo opens with the same guitar riff that harrison had played on it don t come easy ten years before . starr taped the basic track at evergreen recording studios in los angeles on november , with additional recording taking place on december at nassau s compass point studios . among the large cast of musicians supporting starr were nilsson vocals , jim keltner drums , jane getz piano , dennis budimir and richie zito guitars , and a four piece horn section led by saxophonist jerry jumonville . starr overdubbed his vocals on december , four days before the murder of john lennon , who had been due to record his contributions to stop and smell the roses in january . contrasting with his success as a solo artist in , the album continued starr s run of commercial and critical failures since rodriguez writes that m ost people either love or hate the revamping of back off boogaloo . live performance starr has performed back off boogaloo in concert with his all starr band , beginning with the band s debut tour of north america in july september . the song was dropped from the concert setlist early in that tour , however , in favour of the lennon mccartney composition i wanna be your man . live versions of back off boogaloo have appeared on the multi disc compilation the anthology ... so far and king biscuit flower hour presents ringo his new all starr band . the latter version was recorded during a us tour in august , at which point the all starr line up was starr vocals , mark rivera saxophone , ian hunter guitar , roger hodgson and howard jones keyboards , greg lake bass and sheila e. drums . starr also played the song live with ringo and the roundheads , a band he formed to promote his studio album vertical man . a version recorded on may that year at sony music studios , new york , appeared on starr s vh storytellers live album and video , released in october . the personnel on this performance included starr vocals , joe walsh and mark hudson guitars , jack blades bass and simon kirke drums . another live version with the roundheads , recorded for pbs television s soundstage in august , was issued on ringo starr live at soundstage . personnel the following musicians played on the original version of back off boogaloo ringo starr vocals , drums , percussion , backing vocals george harrison slide guitars , acoustic guitar gary wright piano klaus voormann bass , saxophone madeline bell , lesley duncan , jean gilbert backing vocals chart performance where the streets have no name where the streets have no name is a song by irish rock band u . it is the opening track from their album the joshua tree and was released as the album s third single in august . the song s hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect , played during the song s introduction and again at the end . lead vocalist bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person s religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in belfast . during the band s difficulties recording the song , producer brian eno considered erasing the song s tapes to have them start from scratch . where the streets have no name was praised by critics and became a commercial success , peaking at number thirteen in the us , number fourteen in canada , number ten in the netherlands , and number four in the united kingdom . the song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in on the joshua tree tour . the song was performed on a los angeles rooftop for the filming of its music video , which won a grammy award for best performance music video . writing and recording the music for where the streets have no name originated from a demo that guitarist the edge composed the night before the group resumed the joshua tree sessions . in an upstairs room at melbeach house his newly purchased home the edge used a four track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards , bass , guitar , and a drum machine . realising that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs , the edge wanted to conjure up the ultimate u live song , so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future u show if he were a fan . after finishing the rough mix , he felt he had come up with the most amazing guitar part and song of his life . with no one in the house to share the demo with , the edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration . although the band liked the demo , it was difficult for them to record the song . bassist adam clayton said , at the time it sounded like a foreign language , whereas now we understand how it works . the arrangement , with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes , was rehearsed many times , but the group struggled to get a performance they liked . according to co producer daniel lanois , that was the science project song . i remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard , as we call them . i was holding a pointer , like a college professor , walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd . it was ridiculous . co producer brian eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of where the streets have no name . the band worked on a single take for weeks , but as eno explained , that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up . through all of their work , they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance . so much time had been spent on screwdriver work that eno thought it would be best to start from scratch . his idea was to stage an accident and have the song s tapes erased . he said that this was not to force abandonment of the song , but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance . at one point , eno had the tapes cued up and ready to be recorded over , but this erasure never took place according to engineer flood , fellow engineer pat mccarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing eno ready to erase the tapes , dropped the tray of tea he was carrying and physically restrained eno . the studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes . it was one of several songs mixed by steve lillywhite in the final months of recording the joshua tree . drummer larry mullen , jr. later said of the song , it took so long to get that song right , it was difficult for us to make any sense of it . it only became a truly great song through playing live . on the record , musically , it s not half the song it is live . composition where the streets have no name is played at a tempo of beats per minute . the introduction and outro are played in a time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common signature . the songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with chorale like sustained synthesiser notes . the guitar fades in after seconds this part consists of a repeated chiming six note arpeggio . a dotted eighth delay effect is used to play each note in the arpeggio twice , thus creating a rich sound . the bass and drums enter at . the introduction , following a i iv i iv vi v i chord progression , creates a wall of sound , as described by mark butler , against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes . the guitar part played for the remainder of the song features the edge strumming percussive sixteenth notes . the bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while bono s vocal performance , in contrast , varies greatly in its timbre , he sighs he moans he grunts he exhales audibly he allows his voice to crack as well as timing by his usage of rubato to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat . this development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line burning down love a g f d the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song , the a at burning . in later choruses , bono sings blown by the wind with the same melody , stretching the same note even longer . after the third chorus , the song s outro is played , the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction , with a six note guitar arpeggio played against sustained synthesiser notes . lyrics the lyrics were inspired by a story that bono heard about the streets of belfast , northern ireland , where a person s religion and income are evident by the street they live on . he contrasted this with the anonymity he felt when visiting ethiopia , saying ... the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren t such divisions , a place where the streets have no name . to me , that s the way a great rock n roll concert should be a place where everyone comes together ... maybe that s the dream of all art to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all . bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to ethiopia with his wife , ali hewson he first wrote them down on an airsickness bag while staying in a village . according to him , the song is ostensibly about transcendence , elevation , whatever you want to call it . bono , who compared many of his lyrics prior to the joshua tree to sketches , said that where the streets have no name is more like the u of old than any of the other songs on the lp , because it s a sketch i was just trying to sketch a location , maybe a spiritual location , maybe a romantic location . i was trying to sketch a feeling . the open ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations . journalist michael campbell believed the lyrics send a message of hope and wish for a world that is not divided by class , wealth , race , or any other arbitrary criterion . with regard to the place bono was referring to in the song , he said , i m not sure , really , about that . i used to think it was belfast ... journalist niall stokes believes the title was influenced by bono s and his wife ali s visit to ethiopia as volunteer aid workers . bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open ended lyrics i can look at it now and recognize that the song has one of the most banal couplets in the history of pop music . but it also contains some of the biggest ideas . in a curious way , that seems to work . if you get any way heavy about these things , you don t communicate . but if you re flip or throwaway about it , then you do . that s one of the paradoxes i ve come to terms with . release originally , the third single from the joshua tree was meant to be the song red hill mining town , but where the streets have no name was released instead , in august . the single was released on inch , inch , cassette and cd single formats . three b sides were featured on the single , including race against time , silver and gold , and sweetest thing , except for the inch release , which only featured the latter two tracks . the inch single featured race against time on side a of the record despite being a b side , and the cassette single featured all four tracks on both sides of the tape . although not as successful as the album s first two singles , the song did chart well . in the u.s. , the song peaked at number on the billboard hot and number on the album rock tracks charts . the song reached number four on the uk singles chart , and it topped the irish singles chart . music video the video begins with an aerial shot of a block in los angeles , and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc jockeys stating that u is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of , people . police show up to the set and inform the band s crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing , due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance . two minutes into the video , u are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of th ave. and s. main st. , and perform where the streets have no name to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building . towards the end of the song , the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down , and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are booing the police . the video for where the streets have no name was directed by meiert avis and produced by michael hamlyn and ben dossett . the band attracted over , people during the video s filming , which took place on the rooftop of a liquor store in downtown los angeles on march . the band s performance on a rooftop in a public place was a reference to the beatles final concert , as depicted in the film let it be . during the shoot u played an eight song set , which included four performances of where the streets have no name . prior to filming , a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be intruded by a group of fans . a backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator , which happened during filming . the depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming , just as seen in the video . hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police . according to avis , the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day almost in real time , and that getting busted was an integral part of the plan . band manager paul mcguinness revealed in that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to dramatize the music video , but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video . in the background of the video is a sign for the million dollar hotel , which was rebuilt to create some interest , in case no one showed up at the film shoot . although the video is of a live performance , the audio used is from the studio recorded version of the song . the video won the grammy award for best performance music video at the grammy awards . b sides race against time was released on the inch , cassette , and cd versions of the single . the song developed from the band s interest in urban funk , and was described by the edge as a kind of afro rhythmic piece and a study in rhythm . the bass riff in the song , inspired by the bodhrn , was played by the edge , but stemmed from some of clayton s unused bass parts . mullen s drum part was recorded in a single take . the song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by bono s trip to ethiopia after live aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence these lyrical references include bono singing in an ethiopian language and following it with the phrase race against time . bono said of the song , it reminds me of the desert . the desert is so empty , but it aches with a strange kind of fullness . john hutchinson of musician magazine described the song as having an african flavour and as being reminiscent of peter gabriel . the track was used in the miami vice episode child s play , and is the only one of the single s b sides that was never played live . silver and gold was written in support of the artists united against apartheid project , which protested the south african apartheid . in , bono participated in steven van zandt s anti apartheid sun city project and spent time with keith richards and mick jagger of the rolling stones . when richards and jagger played blues , bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre , as most of u s musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid s . bono realised that u had no tradition , and he felt as if they were from outer space . this inspired him to write the blues influenced song silver and gold , which he recorded with richards and ronnie wood . it was re recorded by u for the where the streets have no name single while the band returned to dublin during in may during a break between the first and second legs of the joshua tree tour . the song was described by musician as tough and raw , with bono in husky and confident voice , underpinned by a sinuous bass line , and with the edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues based guitar . silver and gold was played live on the joshua tree tour several times , one performance of which was featured on the band s album and rockumentary , rattle and hum . both the studio recording and the sun city versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the th anniversary edition of the joshua tree . the studio version was also included on the limited edition b sides bonus disk of the band s first compilation album , the best of . sweetest thing was written by bono as an apology to his wife for forgetting her birthday . the song opens with a short piano piece before the rest of the band begins to play . some of bono s lyrics have been described as reminiscent of john lennon . the edge described it as a beautiful song ... which is pop as it should be not produced out of existence , but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity , also noting that it s very new for us . it was re recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in as a single in its own right for the best of . hot press editor niall stokes stated that this track , along with race against time , is an indicator of what u might have made instead of the joshua tree . critical reception upon the release of the joshua tree , critics praised where the streets have no name . steve morse of the boston globe noted the bell like tones from the edge fram e a search for heaven and along with the subsequent track on the album , i still haven t found what i m looking for , these songs showed how the group were pilgrims still on a quest not preachers who claim to have found answers . the bergen record echoed these sentiments , saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest . rolling stone called it assertive rock in their review of the joshua tree . the san diego union tribune said of where the streets have no name , the music charges , like someone fleeing for life . the washington post said the track is a bit oblique lyrically , but the implications are clear in bono s resolute delivery , dave the edge evan s quavering guitar , adam clayton s cathedral bass and larry mullen s rolling thunder drums . nme lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album starts by spitting furiously . the publication praised bono s impassioned singing and the edge s guitar playing , which transformed the instrument into something more than an endlessly abused piece of wood . the review commented that the last ten seconds are breathtakingly beautiful . the rocket wrote that the song builds a wall of sound that bono s vocals cut through with a wail of desperation , as the lyrics agonize the need for personal spirituality . the reviewer compared the opening riff to simple minds ghostdancing . reviewing the joshua tree , stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic called the song an epic opener . the service s steve huey , in a review of the song , praised its insistent , propulsive rhythmic drive and anthemic chorus , qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite . he called the song the perfect album opener , crediting the slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak . huey also called bono s delivery passionate and grandiose and his commitment to the material unshakable . he believed the combination of his vocals and the band s sonic power is what gave u its tremendous force . live performances where the streets have no name made its concert debut on april in tempe , arizona on the opening night of the joshua tree tour . it has since been played at nearly every full length concert that u has headlined , totaling over performances as of . the song is widely regarded as one of the group s most popular live songs . bono said of it , we can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives , but when we go into that song , everything changes . the audience is on its feet , singing along with every word . it s like god suddenly walks through the room . on the joshua tree tour , where the streets have no name was most often used to open concerts . fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting . the san diego union tribune wrote that , from the lofty sonic opening strains of the song , this audience was up , ecstatic and inflamed . nme wrote that the song is one such occasion where the power afforded their songs is scary , noting that during the song s opening , the arena erupts . in other reviews , the song was called uplifting , exhilarating , and powerful . out of the shows during the joshua tree tour , streets was played at all except of the concerts . during the lovetown tour which took place in and the beginning of , streets was only left out of the set list at one of the concerts . the song was performed at every show on the zoo tv tour . concerts from this tour were elaborate multimedia spectacles that bono performed as a variety of characters , but for the end of the main set , the group reverted to playing classics , including where the streets have no name , straight . some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from the joshua tree s photo shoot . the video was speeded up for humorous effect nme described the effect as giving it a silly , charlie chaplin quality and bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens . this video would make a return during performances on the and legs of the u tour . some of the zoo tv performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the pet shop boys synthpop cover of the song titled where the streets have no name i can t take my eyes off you . bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the pet shop boys cover . critics welcomed the song in the group s setlist the independent said the song induces instant euphoria , as u do what they re best at , slipping into epic rock mode , playing music made for the arena . in two other local newspaper reviews , critics praised the song s inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits . for the popmart tour of , u returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the zoo tv tour . the set s massive video screen displayed a video that hot press described as an astonishing , style trip into the heart of a swirling , psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal monolith . near the end of the song , peace doves were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set s golden arch were projected upwards . hot press said the effect transformed the stadium into a ufo landing site . shortly before the third leg of the elevation tour , the september attacks occurred in new york city and washington d.c. during the band s first show in new york city following the attacks , the band performed where the streets have no name , and when the stage lights illuminated the audience , the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans . the experience was one inspiration for the song city of blinding lights . the band paid tribute to the victims during their performance of the song at the super bowl xxxvi halftime show on february . the performance featured the names of the september victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band . u s appearance was later ranked number on sports illustrated s list of top super bowl halftime shows . for the vertigo tour , the group originally considered dropping the song from their setlists , but mullen and clayton successfully argued against this . all of the vertigo tour concerts featured a performance of the song , which were accompanied by the stage s led video curtains displaying african flags . on the tour s opening night , this reminded bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an ethiopian village . he thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle , saying , and here it was , nearly twenty years later , coming back to africa , all the stuff about parched lands and deserts making sense for the first time . the song was also played at the preview screening of the band s concert film u d at the cannes film festival . at the glastonbury festival , the edge accompanied rock band muse for a live cover version of the track , later playing it with u while headlining glastonbury in . live performances of where the streets have no name appear in the concert video releases rattle and hum , zoo tv live from sydney , and popmart live from mexico city , as well as the respective audio releases of the latter two concerts , zoo tv live and hasta la

elevation tour was featured in the concert film elevation live from boston , and on the walk on and electrical storm singles . the concert video and album u go home live from slane castle , ireland featured another performance from the elevation tour , and later performances were featured in the concert films vertigo live from chicago and u d vertigo tour , and u at the rose bowl u tour . the digital album , live from the point depot , contains a performance from the lovetown tour , only available as part of the complete u digital box set . legacy in , q magazine named where the streets have no name the th most exciting tune ever . the following year , q ranked the song at number in a special edition titled best songs ever . three years later , the magazine s readers voted the track the rd greatest song in history . rolling stone ranked the song at number on its list of the greatest guitar songs of all time . in a poll by fan site u , approximately of , respondents named where the streets have no name as their favourite song from the joshua tree , ranking it as the most popular song from the album . in , american sports network espn used the track , among other u songs , in commercials for the fifa world cup , with the south african soweto gospel choir adding vocals to the song . the advertisement , titled robben island , portrays south african political prisoners during the apartheid era forming a soccer team . there are plans to bring a recording of the soweto supported performance to retail . composer john mackey used the introductory guitar theme in his piece for wind ensemble , aurora awakes . the song s introduction was used by the vancouver canucks hockey team at the start each of their home games , when the players take to the ice . the baltimore ravens also use the song as they enter m t bank stadium before home games . the marquette golden eagles men s basketball team uses this song in their entrance video before all home games at the bmo harris bradley center . the song is also used by the wisconsin badgers football team for their entrance video at camp randall stadium prior to all home games . the kansas jayhawks men s basketball team uses

cyclization is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of cyclopentenones . the reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and substrates employed . it was originally discovered by ivan nikolaevich nazarov in while studying the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones . as originally described , the nazarov cyclization involves the activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric lewis acid or protic acid promoter . the key step of the reaction mechanism involves a cationic electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product see mechanism below . as the reaction has been developed , variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than lewis acids have been subsumed under the name nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway . the success of the nazarov cyclization as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products including jasmone , the aflatoxins , and a subclass of prostaglandins and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis . the reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published . mechanism the mechanism of the classical nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocyclization and is outlined below . activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation which undergoes a thermally allowed conrotatory electrocyclization as dictated by the woodward hoffman rules . this generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a hydrogen . subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product . as noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known what designates a nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation . in order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s trans s trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . the propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain . coordination of an electron donating substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation . similarly , substitution directed inward restricts the s trans conformation so severely that e z isomerization has been shown to occur in advance of cyclization on a wide range of substrates , yielding the trans cyclopentenone regardless of initial configuration . in this way , the nazarov cyclization is a rare example of a stereoselective pericyclic reaction , whereas most electrocyclizations are stereospecific . the example below uses triethylsilyl hydride to trap the oxyallyl cation so that no elimination occurs . see interrupted cyclizations below along this same vein , allenyl vinyl ketones of the type studied extensively by marcus tius of the university of hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of hydrogens , obviating a large amount of steric strain in the s cis conformer . classical nazarov cyclizations though cyclizations following the general template above had been observed prior to nazarov s involvement , it was his study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process . nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product . the reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone . research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years , until in the mid s when several syntheses employing the nazarov cyclization were published . shown below are key steps in the syntheses of trichodiene and nor sterepolide , the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne allene isomerization that generates the divinyl ketone . shortcomings the classical version of the nazarov cyclization suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to circumvent . the first two are not evident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative of the barriers to cyclization the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and protonation of the intermediate . strong lewis or protic acids are typically required for the reaction e.g. ticl , bf , mesoh . these promoters are not compatible with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scope . despite the mechanistic possibility for catalysis , multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction . this limits the atom economy of the reaction . the elimination step is not regioselective if multiple hydrogens are available for elimination , various products are often observed as mixtures . this is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as arduous separation is typically required . elimination destroys a potential stereocenter , decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction . protonation of the enolate is sometimes not stereoselective , meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of epimers . modern variants the shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form . however , modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research . in particular , the research has focused on a few key areas rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter , effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance , directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step , and improving the overall stereoselectivity . these have been successful to varying degrees . additionally , modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by generating the pentadienyl cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxyallyl cation intercepted in various ways . furthermore , enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed . the sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field key examples are given below . silicon directed cyclization the earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the nazarov cyclization took advantage of the silicon effect in order to direct the regioselectivity of the elimination step . this chemistry was developed most extensively by professor scott denmark of the university of illinois , urbana champaign in the mid s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron trichloride to promote the reaction . with bicyclic products , the cis isomer was selected for to varying degrees . the silicon directed nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product silphinene , shown below . the cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety , so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether . polarization drawing on the substituent effects compiled over various trials of the reaction , professor alison frontier of the university of rochester developed a paradigm for polarized nazarov cyclizations in which electron donating and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction . creation of an effective vinyl nucleophile and vinyl electrophile in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper triflate and regioselective elimination . in addition , the electron withdrawing group increases the acidity of the proton , allowing selective formation of the trans epimer via equilibration . it is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a donating or withdrawing group alone , although the efficiency of the reaction yield , reaction time , etc . is typically lower . alternative cation generation by extension , any pentadienyl cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a nazarov cyclization . there have been a large number of examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements . one such example involves the silver catalyzed cationic ring opening of allylic dichloro cylopropanes . the silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride . in the total synthesis of rocaglamide , epoxidation of a vinyl alkoxyallenyl stannane likewise generates a pentadienyl cation via ring opening of the resultant epoxide . interrupted cyclization once the cyclization has occurred , an oxyallyl cation is formed . as discussed extensively above , the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization . however , these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles , respectively . oxyallyl cation trapping has been developed extensively by fredrick g. west of the university of alberta and his review covers the field . the oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners . shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity . enolate trapping with various electrophiles is decidedly less common . in one study , the nazarov cyclization is paired with a michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to nitrostyrene . in this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions it acts as the lewis acid in the nazarov cyclization and in the next step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the r group . enantioselective variants the development of an enantioselective nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of nazarov cyclization reactions . to that end , several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts . diastereoselective cyclizations are also known , in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization . almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of torquoselectivity selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to rotate in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below . silicon directed nazarov cyclizations can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way . in the example below , the silyl group acts to direct the cyclization by preventing the distant alkene from rotating towards it via unfavorable steric interaction . in this way the silicon acts as a traceless auxiliary . the starting material is not enantiopure but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the cyclization . tius s allenyl substrates can exhibit axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used . the example below generates a chiral diosphenpol in yield and enantiomeric excess . tius has additionally developed a camphor based auxiliary for achiral allenes that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of roseophilin . the key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent . the first chiral lewis acid promoted asymmetric nazarov cyclization was reported by varinder aggarwal and utilized copper ii bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to ee . the enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of mol of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased . related reactions extensions of the nazarov cyclization are generally also subsumed under the same name . for example , an , unsaturated ketone can undergo a similar cationic conrotatory cyclization that is typically referred to as an iso nazarov cyclization reaction . other such extensions have been given similar names , including homo nazarov cyclizations and vinylogous nazarov cyclizations . retro nazarov reaction because they overstabilize the pentadienyl cation , electron donating substiuents often severely impede nazarov cyclization . building from this , several electrocyclic ring openings of alkoxy cyclopentanes have been reported . these are typically referred to as retro nazarov cyclization reactions . imino nazarov reaction nitrogen analogues of the nazarov cyclization reaction known as imino nazarov cyclization reactions have few instances there is one example of a generalized imino nazarov cyclization reported shown below , and several iso imino nazarov reactions in the literature . even these tend to suffer from poor stereoselectivity , poor yields , or narrow scope . the difficulty stems from the relative over stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation , impeding cyclization . horrible bosses horrible bosses is a american black comedy film directed by seth gordon , written by michael markowitz , john francis daley and jonathan goldstein , based on a story by markowitz . it stars jason bateman , charlie day , jason sudeikis , jennifer aniston , colin farrell , kevin spacey , and jamie foxx . the plot follows three friends , played by bateman , day , and sudeikis , who decide to murder their respective overbearing , abusive bosses , portrayed by spacey , aniston and farrell . markowitz s script was bought by new line cinema in and the film spent six years in various states of pre production , with a variety of actors attached to different roles . by , goldstein and daley had rewritten the script , and the film finally went into production . the film premiered in los angeles on june , , and received a wide release on july , . the film exceeded financial expectations , accruing over million in the first three days , making it the number two film in the united states during its opening weekend , and going on to become the highest grossing black comedy film of all time in unadjusted dollars , breaking the record previously set by the war of the roses in . the film grossed over million worldwide during its theatrical run . the film opened to positive critical reception , with several critics praising the ensemble cast , with each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews . the plot received a more mixed response some reviewers felt that its dark , humorous premise was explored well , while others felt the jokes were racist , homophobic , and misogynistic . a sequel , horrible bosses , was released on november , . plot nick hendricks bateman and dale arbus day are friends who despise their bosses . nick works at a financial firm for the sadistic david harken spacey , who implies the possibility of a promotion for nick for months , only to award it to himself . dale is a dental assistant being sexually harassed by his boss , dr. julia harris aniston she threatens to tell his fiancee stacy lindsay sloane that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her . nick and dale s accountant friend kurt buckman sudeikis enjoys working for jack pellitt donald sutherland at a chemical company , but after jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack , the company is taken over by jack s cocaine addicted son bobby farrell , whose apathy and incompetence threaten the future of the company . at night , over drinks , kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer around . initially hesitant , they eventually agree to kill their employers . in search of a hitman , the trio meet dean motherfuckah jones foxx , an ex con who agrees to be their murder consultant . jones suggests that dale , kurt and nick kill each other s bosses to hide their motive while making the deaths look like accidents . the three reconnoiter bobby s house , and kurt steals bobby s phone . they next go to harken s house , where kurt and nick go inside while dale waits in the car . harken returns home and confronts dale for littering , but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter on the litter . dale saves harken by stabbing him with an epipen . nick and kurt think dale is stabbing harken to death and flee , with kurt accidentally dropping bobby s phone in harken s bedroom . the next night , kurt watches julia s home , but she seduces and has sex with him . nick and dale reluctantly wait outside bobby s and harken s houses , respectively , to commit the murders , despite neither of them wanting to . harken discovers bobby s cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address , suspecting his wife rhonda julie bowen is having an affair . he drives over and kills bobby , with nick as a secret witness . nick flees at high speed , setting off a traffic camera . the trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan . they are arrested by the police , who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in bobby s murder . lacking evidence , the police are forced to let the trio go free . the trio consult with jones again , but learn that he never actually killed anyone , having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film snow falling on cedars . jones suggests that they get harken to confess and secretly tape it . the three accidentally crash harken s surprise birthday party , where nick and dale get harken to confess to the murder before realizing that kurt , who has the audio recorder , is elsewhere having sex with rhonda . harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him . they flee by car , but harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle . believing they have committed a crime , the car s navigation system operator remotely disables kurt s car , allowing harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint . harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness . the police arrest nick , dale and kurt , but the navigation system operator , gregory , reveals that it is his companies policy to record all conversations for quality assurance . gregory plays the tape that has harken confessing he murdered pellitt . harken is sentenced to years to life in prison , while the friends get their charges waived . nick is promoted to president of the company under a sadistic ceo , kurt retains his job under a new boss , and dale blackmails julia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass a supposedly unconscious patient , while jones secretly records the act . cast jason bateman as nick hendricks an executive at a financial firm who is manipulated into jumping through hoops in order to get a promotion that his boss never intended to give him . markowitz wrote the role specifically for bateman . charlie day as dale arbus a dental assistant who is sexually harassed by his boss . described as a hopeless romantic in love with his fiance . ashton kutcher was in talks for the role at two different points in the lengthy production . day was considered for the role following his co starring performance with sudeikis in the film going the distance reuters reported that industry insiders believed his performance overshadowed the main stars . jason sudeikis as kurt buckman an account manager at a chemical company dealing with a new , drug addicted boss after his beloved former boss dies . sudeikis was cast in may . jennifer aniston as dr. julia harris , d.d.s. markowitz based the character on a former boss , claiming she was very sexually aggressive with everybody . when writing the script , markowitz intended for the role to go to aniston . he stated , but the aforementioned boss looked more like cruella de vil . it was like flirting with a cobweb . so i decided for the sake of the movie , let s go with jennifer aniston . the actress insisted on wearing a brown wig for the role , wanting to look different from other characters she had played . colin farrell as bobby pellitt described as a weaselly scion and a corrupt and incompetent jerk who s in charge of things but clearly has no idea what he s doing . farrell explained the motivation he gave to the character , stating this guy thinks he s god s gift to women , god s gift to intellect , to humor , to the club scene , to everything . it s all part of his grandiose sense of self esteem , which is probably masking a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with kurt , and all kinds of other things . with pellit , seth gave me complete license to act as pathologically screwed up as possible . farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character , suggesting the comb over hairstyle , pot belly and an affinity for chinese dragons . kevin spacey as david harken president of comnidyne industries . tom cruise , philip seymour hoffman and jeff bridges had been approached by new line cinema to take the role , described as a psychopathic master manipulator with an attractive wife . spacey signed up for the role in june . the part was considered integral to the film . gordon commented that the character was an amalgamation of several real bosses rather than one single person to avoid being sued . jamie foxx as dean motherfuckah jones the character had the more colorful name cocksucker jones , but it was changed at foxx s request , with producer jay stern commenting that foxx felt it was over the line . the current name was said to be subject to further change , prior to the release of the film . foxx contributed to his character s appearance , suggesting full scalp tattoos and a retro clothing style . foxx described the appearance as a guy who maybe went to jail for a minute and now he s living in his own time capsule . when he got out he went right back to the clothes he thought were hot when he went in . during the six year development of the film , several actors were in negotiations to star , including owen wilson , vince vaughn , matthew mcconaughey , ryan reynolds , dax shepard , and johnny knoxville . donald sutherland portrays jack pellitt , bobby s father and kurt s boss . on july , , isaiah mustafa was confirmed as joining the cast . mustafa was quoted as saying it s a smaller role . he appears as officer wilkens . julie bowen appears in the film as rhonda , harken s wife . bowen stated that her character may or may not be a hussy , the character described as intentionally making her husband jealous . ioan gruffudd has a cameo as a male prostitute erroneously hired as a hitman . lindsay sloane appears as dale s fiancee stacy . p. j. byrne plays kenny sommerfeld , a former investment manager , now scrounging for drinks , while wendell pierce and ron white play a pair of cops . bob newhart makes a cameo as sadistic comnidyne ceo louis sherman . john francis daley , a screenwriter on the film , cameos as nick s co worker carter . production development markowitz s script for horrible bosses was sold at auction to new line cinema by ratner s production company rat entertainment in for a six figure amount . ratner initially was interested in directing , but became occupied with directing the comedy tower heist . frank oz and david dobkin were in talks to direct . jonathan goldstein and john francis daley rewrote the script in , and the project went into production with seth gordon directing . design production designer shepherd frankel specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses homes and offices . nick and harken s workplace is the comnidyne bullpen , which was designed to enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office . the design team met with financial strategists and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low ranking position in a cubicle and aspiring to an office . costume designer carol ramsey worked with frankel and set decorator jan pascale to match harken s suit to that of the surrounding cold grey and blue color palette of his office . harken s home was described as equally lacking in warmth as the office but more lavishly decorated and for show , including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his trophy wife . designing julia s office was described as a challenge , infusing a sensual vibe into a dental office . frankel approached the design through julia s mentality , stating , she s a type a professional at the top of her game , who likes to play cat and mouse , so it s a completely controlled environment , with apertures and views into other rooms so she always knows what s going on . it s highly designed , with rich wallpaper and tones , sumptuous artwork and subtle lighting all very disarming till you step into her private office . the blinds close , the door locks and you think , it s the temple of doom . similarly approaching the character s home , the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she couldn t get away with at work . bobby s environments were designed with more contrast , the character being new to the work area . frankel described the contrast as the company reflects jack pellitt s human touch , whereas bobby pellitt s home is a shameless shrine to himself and his hedonistic appetites . frankel continued , it features a mishmash of anything he finds exotic and erotic , mostly egyptian and asian motifs with an s studio vibe , a makeshift dojo , lots of mirrors and a massage table . some parts of the house design were provided by farrell and gordon s interpretation of the character and his infatuation with martial arts and his delusions of prowess . filming filming of horrible bosses took place in and around los angeles . the production team attempted to find locations that people haven t already seen a hundred times in movies and on tv , aiming for the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere in america where people are trying to pursue the american dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss . comnidyine was represented by an office building in torrance , california , with the crew building the set on a vacant floor . for pellitt chemical , the production team found a perfect landscape of pipes and containers in santa fe springs , surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility . to take advantage of the surrounding imagery , the warehouse required an extensive series of overhauls , including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new doorways to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of sutherland s character . a t.g.i. friday s in woodland hills , los angeles , was used as a bar frequented by nick , dale , and kurt , while the bar scene where they meet with jones was staged in downtown los angeles . the film was shot digitally using the panavision genesis camera . gordon encouraged the actors to improvise , though aniston claimed to not have taken advantage of the offer as much as her co stars , stating , my dialogue was just so beautifully choreographed that there wasn t much that i needed to do . music the soundtrack was composed by award winning composer christopher lennertz , with music contributed by mike mccready of pearl jam , stefan lessard of dave matthews band and money mark a collaborator with the beastie boys . mccready , lessard , and mark worked with musicians matt chamberlain , david levita , aaron kaplan , victor indrizzo , chris chaney , davey chegwidden and dj cheapshot to develop the music . major contributions were provided by mark on keyboard , mccready and levita on guitar , chaney and lessard on bass , indrizzo on drums and dj cheapshot on turntables . lennertz recorded the soundtrack at the village recording studio in west los angeles and capitol records . lennertz attempted to remain authentic to the characters progression from average worker to calculated killer . to achieve this aim , he decided against recording digitally , instead recording the tracks on two inch analog tape , intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record . he explained , the idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album . it isn t over produced or shiny and digital in any way . it s brash , noisy , and full of bravado and swagger . i knew that if we could harness some of this sonic magic in the score , then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against bateman , sudeikis , and charlie day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire . lennertz continued , we tracked through tape before pro tools to get that fat sound , and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection . we even used the same wurlitzer that money mark played on beck s classic where it s at . at the end of the day , seth gordon and i wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself . i think we did it ... and most of all , everyone had a blast in the process . horrible bosses the original motion picture soundtrack was released in physical and digital formats on july , , by watertower music . the soundtrack consists of tracks with a runtime of minutes . release the world premiere of horrible bosses took place on june , at grauman s chinese theatre in hollywood , california . box office horrible bosses grossed .

critical reception horrible bosses received generally positive reviews from critics . on rotten tomatoes , the film holds a rating of , based on reviews , with an average rating of . . the site s critical consensus reads , it s nasty , uneven , and far from original , but thanks to a smartly assembled cast that makes the most of a solid premise , horrible bosses works . review aggregate metacritic gave the film a score of out of , based on critics , indicating mixed or average reviews . roger ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four , calling it well cast and commending it for playing to each actor s strengths . ebert gave particular praise to spacey , labeling him superb , and aniston , judging her performance to be a surprise and a return to form , stating she has acute comic timing and hilariously enacts alarming sexual hungers . ebert called horrible bosses cheerful and wicked . lisa schwarzbaum of entertainment weekly reacted positively , calling the film a bouncy , well built , delightfully nasty tale of resentment , desperation , and amoral revenge and complimented the casting of the protagonists and antagonists . the a.v. club s nathan rabin also praised the cast , stating that the picture succeeds almost entirely on the chemistry of its three leads , who remain likeable even while resorting to homicide , adding the acting more than compensates for the film s other failings . rabin singled out day s performance as a potent illustration of how a brilliant character actor with a spark of madness can elevate a ramshackle lowbrow farce into a solid mainstream comedy through sheer force of charisma . edward douglas of comingsoon.net credited director seth gordon with having assembled the perfect cast , claiming the six leads kill in every scene , but echoed nathan rabin s sentiments that day is the real standout . douglas summarized the picture as dark fun that works better than expected due to a well developed script , an impeccable cast and a director who knows how to put the two together . a. o. scott of the new york times stated the timing of the cast ... is impeccable and appreciated that the script did not attempt to cut its coarseness with a hypocritical dose of sweetness or respectability . the review concluded that in the ways that count and even when it shouldn t , horrible bosses works . usa today s scott bowles awarded the film three out of four stars , labeling it a surprising comedy that rivals bridesmaids as the funniest film of the summer , if not the year . bowles added that the characters are so likable , giving particular credit to sudeikis though also adding praise for the performances of bateman and day . the dialogue was also lauded by bowles , which commented that seth gordon has a deft touch with water cooler talk even when the water cooler might be spiked with poison . leonard maltin of indiewire considered day to have had the breakout role and offered praise to the performances of the cast , but lamented the lack of screen time for farrell s character . maltin concluded the movie has just enough raunchiness to identify it as a comedy , just enough cleverness to admire , and just the right camaraderie among its three male stars , which turns out to be the movie s greatest strength . rolling stone s peter travers gave kudos to the killer cast , with specific credit given to bateman and day , but was critical of the movie , stating it wussies out on a sharp premise and that it is a hit and miss farce that leaves you wishing it was funnier than it is the guardian s philip french called horrible bosses a lumbering , misogynistic affair , but admitted i laughed frequently , probably to the detriment of my self respect . nicholas barber of the independent gave a positive review , complimenting gordon for not allowing the actors improvisation to be detrimental to the pacing , but felt the movie was not as dark as its premise required , saying what edginess the film does have comes instead from the inordinate quantity of swearing , plus a smattering of homophobia and misogyny . salon s andrew o hehir offered a mixed response , characterizing the film as a lot funnier in theory than in practice , but it won t ruin your saturday night . salon appreciated the effortless comic chemistry between sudeikis , bateman and day and

negatively , stating the jokes failed to be funny , stating seth gordon shows no flair for turning the absurdities and cartoonish characters in the script ... into anything more than a collection of moments in search of laughs . karina longworth of the village voice was critical of the premise , which she felt lacked any legitimate rage against the characters bosses , stating ... there s every sign that , even without these particular emasculators , dale , kurt and nick would still be for lack of a better word total pussies . longworth felt that the humor was rarely actually laugh out loud funny , and never truly dark or daring . she particularly criticized the all white , male protagonists and a plot she deemed racist and filled with stereotypes . justin chang of variety praised the performance of the ensemble cast , but considered the plot to be predictably moronic , vulgar and juvenile . chang echoed the sentiments of the village voice in lamenting that the film failed to pursue the premise to darker , more daring territory and faulted it for falling back on over the top comic exaggeration . accolades the film received several award nominations , including a satellite

conspiracy by a group of high ranking followers of bhagwan shree rajneesh later known as osho to assassinate charles turner , the then united states attorney for the district of oregon . rajneesh s personal secretary and second in command , ma anand sheela sheela silverman , assembled the group after turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at rajneeshpuram . turner investigated charges of immigration fraud and sham marriages , and later headed the federal prosecution of the rajneeshee bioterror attack in the dalles , oregon . the conspirators included ma anand sheela , sally anne croft , chief financial officer of rajneeshpuram susan hagan , head of security at rajneeshpuram , catherine jane stork , who bought weapons and silencers and volunteered to be the actual murderer ann phyllis mccarthy , fourth in command of rajneeshpuram and co conspirators alma potter , carol matthews , phyllis caldwell and richard kevin langford . the conspirators obtained false identification to purchase handguns out of state , stalked turner , and planned to murder him near his workplace in portland , oregon . the assassination plot was never carried out and was only discovered later , as a result of the investigation by federal law enforcement into the bioterror attack in the dalles and other illegal acts by the rajneeshpuram leadership . prosecution of the conspirators began in , when a federal grand jury brought indictments against several of the key players . some had fled the country , and extradition proceedings against the perpetrators and subsequent prosecution and conviction was not completed for sixteen years . the final conspirator was convicted in , when catherine jane stork agreed to return to the united states from germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in australia . eight perpetrators received sentences ranging from five years probation to five years in federal prison and an additional member of the rajneesh

reenter the country without permission from the u.s. attorney general . planning hit list seven followers called rajneeshees of charismatic leader bhagwan shree rajneesh now known as osho , were convicted of a conspiracy to assassinate charles turner , and an additional unindicted eighth member of the rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy . the perpetrators were high ranking followers within the rajneeshee organization . prosecutors in the case stated that the perpetrators had planned to murder turner after he was appointed to head an investigation into the group s activities in rajneeshpuram , oregon . turner s investigation focused on sham marriages organized by the group , as well as other illegal activities including immigration fraud , and he later headed the federal prosecution relating to the rajneeshee bioterror attack in the dalles , oregon . oregon attorney general dave frohnmayer was also involved in investigations of the group , working alongside turner . in may , rajneesh s personal secretary and second in command , sheela silverman ma anand sheela , gathered the leader s key followers and formed a group of conspirators in order to plan the assassination of turner , as well as several dissidents among their organization . sheela stated that turner s grand jury investigation threatened the existence of the commune , and exposed rajneesh and several of his disciples to criminal prosecution . sheela hoped that by murdering turner they would be able to thwart the federal immigration investigation which could have resulted in deportation of rajneeshee leaders . three former leaders of the commune including ma anand sheela , dianne yvonne onang ma anand puja , a registered nurse from the philippines who managed the rajneeshee medical corporation , and former treasurer of rajneesh foundation international and catherine jane stork ma shanti bhadra of australia , put together a hit list which included u.s. attorney

ma idam shunyo , who had been awarded us . million in a lawsuit against rajneesh foundation international , her daughter barbara j. byron makima , and rajneesh s former secretary laxmi thakarsi kuruwa ma yoga laxmi . weapons catherine jane stork volunteered to be the follower who would actually murder turner , and bought guns and silencers . stork was known to fellow followers as ma shanti bhadra , and was also one of the three big mammas in rajneeshpuram . sally anne croft known by followers as ma prem savita , an accountant and the group s chief financial officer , provided money for the purchase of weapons related to the plot . phyllis caldwell ma deva ritka described in a federal affidavit how members of the murder conspiracy obtained handguns , referring to catherine jane stork and sally anne croft shanti b went down to jesus grove , and savita gave us several thousand dollars to use to buy guns . jesus grove referred to a group of trailers where all the leaders of the rajneesh commune resided , except for bhagwan shree rajneesh . ma anand sheela and three other rajneesh followers traveled to new york in the spring of to acquire false identification . according to a federal indictment , the perpetrators of the assassination plot used a false birth certificate to purchase guns . two members of the group then traveled to texas to purchase handguns . caldwell stated she and catherine jane stork flew to texas to purchase guns there . they purchased five guns in texas , but encountered difficulty purchasing handguns in texas with out of state identification and traveled to new mexico instead . caldwell said they called back to the commune but the women were instructed not to come back without the guns . in new mexico , they obtained false identification , and purchased several pistols . their intention was to purchase guns which were difficult to trace . caldwell said it was easy to obtain guns in new mexico we found it was pretty easy to buy guns . all you had to do was show some identification and it was easy to get . caldwell said she and stork went to a university library to find the identity of someone dying very young , next went to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate and described how we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt . and then we were able to go to several different gun shops in albuquerque with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets , said caldwell . they were able to obtain one colt . caliber revolver , and four ruger . caliber security six magnum revolvers . the conspirators smuggled the guns into oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a greyhound lines bus . caldwell said that she and stork traveled by bus back to the rajneesh commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors . surveillance after obtaining guns the conspirators returned to portland , oregon . they rented out an apartment in portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of turner . rajneesh follower carol matthews ma prem samadhi used a fake name during the planning of the assassination plot , in an attempt to obtain the home address of charles turner . according to federal prosecutors matthews obtained a college yearbook of turner s , and learned his car s license plate number and his parking location . court records state that matthews and an unindicted co conspirator gave voter registration officials fake identities and told officials they were conducting a voter survey on president reagan s economic plan , in order to obtain turner s route number and post office box number . the two tried repeating the story with members of the u.s. postal service , but the postal officials did not give them turner s address . they then drove around turner s neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said turner . matthews had pictures of turner s residence developed these were later obtained by the federal bureau of investigation fbi during an investigation of the rajneesh commune , and verified after being shown to turner . members of the group of conspirators watched turner s office , home and car , and discussed methods to assassinate him , hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into rajneeshpuram . their plan was to shoot turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked , in portland , oregon , but the conspirators also debated whether to murder turner in downtown portland or closer to his home . after spending multiple nights watching turner s house , the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work , or in front of his home . turner had a reserved parking spot in a federal garage underneath terry schrunk plaza in portland , oregon . in an affidavit given to the fbi , conspirator alma peralta described how the perpetrators decided on the federal parking garage as the location shanti bhadra catherine jane stork said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off . the conspirators practiced different ways of murdering turner . according to informant statements to law enforcement , one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble , and the others would then approach turner with their guns . informants later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of rajneesh communes if the plan was successful . according to the oregonian the assassinations were not carried out because ma anand sheela became distracted by political power plays within the rajneesh commune and other members of the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group . prosecutions investigation on february , , congressman james h. weaver gave a speech in the united states house of representatives in which he asserted that the rajneeshees were involved in the bioterror attack in oregon . at a series of press conferences in september , rajneesh accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of

of rajneesh . there were not simply plans , but at least one assassination attempt , said weaver at the hearing . a grand jury investigation led by turner brought charges of widespread immigration
